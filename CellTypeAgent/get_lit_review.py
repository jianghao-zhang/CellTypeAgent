**Task**: Extract and summarize evidence supporting the relationship between the predicted cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}" and the marker genes "{task_info['marker_genes']}".

#### Instructions:
1. **Identify Relevant Evidence**: Find descriptions that discuss the expression or role of any of the marker genes (in "{task_info['marker_genes']}") in relation to the predicted cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}".
2. **Extract Key Points**: For each marker gene (in "{task_info['marker_genes']}"):
    - Extract concise evidence directly connecting it to the predicted cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}".
    - Include only direct evidence from the literature. Do not speculate or infer connections.
    - If evidence refers to a different cell type, omit it entirely.
    - Be brief, accurate, and stick strictly to the information provided in the literature.
    - If a gene is not mentioned in relation to the predicted cell type in the literature, do not include it as evidence.
    - Avoid any indirect speculation or forced connections.
3. **Cite Sources**: Provide PMCIDs for each piece of evidence. The evidence should be directly connecting the marker gene to the predicted cell type.
4. **Certainty Level**: Determine the certainty level based on the number of matched marker genes. Use the following criteria:
        - High: 7 or more matched genes
        - Medium: 4 to 6 matched genes
        - Low: 1 to 3 matched genes
        - No evidence: 0 matched genes
    Do not fabricate or estimate information; use only the evidence found in the literature.

#### Output Format:
- Predicted Cell Type: {task_info['cell_type']}
- Provided Marker Genes: {task_info['marker_genes']}
- Evidence Summary:
    - Evidence for Gene xxx: [Description of evidence, including the source content in quotation marks and then show your understanding of the evidence.] (Citation: PMCID X)
    - Evidence for Gene xxx: [Description of evidence, including the source content in quotation marks and then show your understanding of the evidence.] (Citation: PMCID Y, PMCID Z, ...)
    - ...
- Matched Marker Genes: [Based on the evidence, list the marker genes in "{task_info['marker_genes']}" that are showing strong correlation with the predicted cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}"]
- Number of Matched Marker Genes: [Return the number of matched marker genes in "**Matched Marker Genes**".]
- Certainty Level: [Return the certainty level as: High (Number of Matched Marker Genes >= 8) or Medium (Number of Matched Marker Genes >= 6 but < 8) or Low (Number of Matched Marker Genes >= 1 but < 6) or No-evidence (Number of Matched Marker Genes = 0)]

Your task is to extract and summarize specific evidence supporting the relationship between the cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}" and the marker genes: "{task_info['marker_genes']}".

Instructions:
1. **Identify Relevant Evidence**: Look for descriptions in the paper segments that discuss the expression or role of any of the marker genes ("{task_info['marker_genes']}") in relation to the cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}".
2. **Extract Key Points**: For each marker gene in "{task_info['marker_genes']}", extract sentences or paragraphs that provide direct evidence, such as experimental results, data analysis, or expert opinions connecting the marker gene to the cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}" in the paper segments. If the evidence is about another cell type, please say so, do not forcefully link the unrelevant evidence to the predicted cell type. Be short and concise. If there's not enough information that can support the relationship between the marker gene and the cell type, please say so. If there's no evidence for a marker gene and the cell type relationship, it's okay to say so. Do not make up any information.
3. **Cite the Source**: Provide the source information like the pmcid for each extracted piece of evidence.
4. **Summarize the Findings**: Write a concise summary that integrates the evidence to explain how the marker genes support or confirm the identification of the cell type "{task_info['cell_type']}".

Output Format:

- **Provided Marker Genes**: {task_info['marker_genes']}
