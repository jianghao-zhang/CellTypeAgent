Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Tff1: Members of the trefoil family are characterized by having at least one copy of the trefoil motif, a 40-amino acid domain that contains three conserved disulfides. They are stable secretory proteins expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa. Their functions are not defined, but they may protect the mucosa from insults, stabilize the mucus layer, and affect healing of the epithelium. This gene, which is expressed in the gastric mucosa, has also been studied because of its expression in human tumors. This gene and two other related trefoil family member genes are found in a cluster on chromosome 21. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gkn1: The protein encoded by this gene is found to be down-regulated in human gastric cancer tissue as compared to normal gastric mucosa. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gkn2: The secretory protein encoded by this gene is produced in gastric surface mucous cells, where it can bind trefoil factor family peptide 1 or gastrokine-1. This gene may be a tumor suppressor gene, as its expression is markedly decreased in gastric cancer tissues. The encoded protein interacts with gastrokine-1 and regulates homeostasis of the gastric mucosa. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]
- Gsta1: This gene encodes a member of a family of enzymes that function to add glutathione to target electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and products of oxidative stress. This action is an important step in detoxification of these compounds. This subfamily of enzymes has a particular role in protecting cells from reactive oxygen species and the products of peroxidation. Polymorphisms in this gene influence the ability of individuals to metabolize different drugs. This gene is located in a cluster of similar genes and pseudogenes on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]
- Psca: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. This gene is up-regulated in a large proportion of prostate cancers and is also detected in cancers of the bladder and pancreas. This gene includes a polymorphism that results in an upstream start codon in some individuals; this polymorphism is thought to be associated with a risk for certain gastric and bladder cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010]
- Lgals2: This gene encodes a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding proteins. Members of this protein family have an affinity for beta-galactosides. The encoded protein is characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich tandem repeat domain and a single C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. This protein can self-associate through the N-terminal domain allowing it to bind to multivalent saccharide ligands. This protein localizes to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This protein plays a role in numerous cellular functions including apoptosis, innate immunity, cell adhesion and T-cell regulation. The protein exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]
- Dpcr1: Predicted to be located in cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Predicted to be integral component of membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- 2210407C18Rik: Gene ID not found
- Tff2: Members of the trefoil family are characterized by having at least one copy of the trefoil motif, a 40-amino acid domain that contains three conserved disulfides. They are stable secretory proteins expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa. Their functions are not defined, but they may protect the mucosa from insults, stabilize the mucus layer and affect healing of the epithelium. The encoded protein inhibits gastric acid secretion. This gene and two other related trefoil family member genes are found in a cluster on chromosome 21. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gsto1: The protein encoded by this gene is an omega class glutathione S-transferase (GST) with glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities. GSTs are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and carcinogens. The encoded protein acts as a homodimer and is found in the cytoplasm. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Tff1, Gkn1, Gkn2, Gsta1, Psca, Lgals2, Dpcr1, 2210407C18Rik, Tff2, and Gsto1. I'll need to go through each gene's description to understand where they're expressed and their functions.

Starting with Tff1: The summary mentions it's part of the trefoil family, expressed in the gastric mucosa, involved in protecting the mucosa and healing the epithelium. So this suggests stomach-related cells, maybe gastric epithelial cells.

Gkn1 and Gkn2 are next. Both are mentioned in the context of gastric mucosa and are downregulated in gastric cancers. Gkn2 specifically is produced in gastric surface mucous cells. This reinforces the idea of gastric epithelial cells, perhaps surface mucous cells.

Gsta1 is involved in detoxification and is part of the glutathione S-transferase family. These enzymes are often found in liver cells (hepatocytes) for detox processes, but they can also be present in other epithelial cells. However, considering the other markers, maybe it's part of gastric cells' defense mechanisms.

Psca is a gene expressed in prostate, bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. It's upregulated in some cancers like prostate and bladder. But since the question is about mouse cells and the other markers are gastric-related, Psca's presence here might point to stomach epithelial cells or maybe a specific subtype like gastric stem cells or certain glandular cells.

Lgals2 is a galectin involved in various functions including mucosal immunity and cell adhesion. Galectins can be found in immune cells, but also in epithelial cells. Given the other markers, maybe it's part of the gastric mucosa's immune response or epithelial structure.

Dpcr1 and 2210407C18Rik are less clear. Dpcr1 is predicted to be in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, but not much else. The other gene ID wasn't found, so maybe it's not relevant or a less studied marker.

Tff2 is another trefoil factor family member, similar to Tff1, also in gastric mucosa, inhibits gastric acid. So this would be more specific to cells in the stomach, maybe the parietal cells or mucous neck cells involved in acid regulation.

Gsto1 is another glutathione transferase, similar to Gsta1. Again, detox, possibly in the same cell types as Gsta1. Since both are present, maybe they're part of a detox pathway in gastric cells.

Putting this all together: most markers (Tff1, Tff2, Gkn1, Gkn2, Psca) are strongly associated with gastric mucosa, specifically surface mucous cells or other epithelial cells in the stomach. Gsta1 and Gsto1 might be part of the detox in these cells. Lgals2 could be involved in mucosal immunity there. The presence of multiple gastric-specific markers makes me think the top cell types are all related to the stomach's epithelial lining. 

The possible cell types could be:

1. Gastric Surface Mucous Cells (since Gkn2 is specifically mentioned here)
2. Gastric Chief Cells (though usually they produce pepsin, but TFFs are in mucous cells)
3. Alternatively, maybe Gastric Pit Cells or other epithelial cells. But considering the markers, surface mucous cells are most likely.

Another angle: TFF1 and TFF2 are also involved in mucus stabilization. Gastrokines (Gkn1, Gkn2) are produced in gastric mucosa. So the top three would likely be:

1. Gastric Surface Mucous Cells
2. Gastric Epithelial Cells (general)
3. Maybe Gastrointestinal Mucosal Cells (but more specific to stomach)

Since the question is for mouse cells, and the markers are specific to gastric mucosa, the top three are likely all gastric-related. So the answer should be:

Gastric Surface Mucous Cells, Gastric Epithelial Cells, Gastric Chief Cells.

Wait, but chief cells are more about digestive enzymes. Alternatively, maybe other types like mucous neck cells. But given the info, the markers point more to surface mucous cells. The presence of Psca might indicate a stem cell or progenitor cell in the stomach, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe enterocytes, but those are intestinal. No, the markers are mostly gastric. 

So the top 3 cell types are likely:

1. Gastric Surface Mucous Cells
2. Gastric Epithelial Cells
3. Gastric Pit Cells (since pit cells are part of the surface epithelium)

Alternatively, perhaps Chief Cells or Parietal Cells, but I think the markers are more mucous-related. So final answer: Gastric Surface Mucous Cells, Gastric Epithelial Cells, Gastrointestinal Mucosal Cells. But "Gastrointestinal" is broader. The problem states "mouse cells", so the most specific would be gastric. So maybe:

1. Gastric Surface Mucous Cells
2. Gastric Mucous Neck Cells
3. Gastric Epithelial Cells

But I need to check standard cell types. In the stomach, the epithelium has surface mucous cells, mucous neck cells, parietal cells, chief cells, and endocrine cells. Surface mucous cells line the lumen and secrete mucus. Mucous neck cells are in the gastric glands and also produce mucus but are a different type. Since Gkn2 is in surface mucous cells, that's the first. Tff1 and Tff2 are also in gastric mucosa. So top 3 cell types:

1. Gastric Surface Mucous Cells
2. Gastric Mucous Neck Cells
3. Gastric Epithelial Cells (general)

Alternatively, maybe Chief cells aren't involved here. Alternatively, if considering other organs, but all markers point to stomach. Therefore, the answer should be three gastric-related cell types, with Surface Mucous Cells as the top, followed by other mucosal cells.
