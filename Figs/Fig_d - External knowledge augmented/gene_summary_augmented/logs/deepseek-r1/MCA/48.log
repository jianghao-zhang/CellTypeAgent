Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Cpa2: Three different forms of human pancreatic procarboxypeptidase A have been isolated. The encoded protein represents the A2 form, which is a monomeric protein with different biochemical properties from the A1 and A3 forms. The A2 form of pancreatic procarboxypeptidase acts on aromatic C-terminal residues and is a secreted protein. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]
- Cpa1: This gene encodes a member of the carboxypeptidase A family of zinc metalloproteases. This enzyme is produced in the pancreas and preferentially cleaves C-terminal branched-chain and aromatic amino acids from dietary proteins. This gene and several family members are present in a gene cluster on chromosome 7. Mutations in this gene may be linked to chronic pancreatitis, while elevated protein levels may be associated with pancreatic cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2015]
- Ctrb1: This gene encodes a member of the serine protease family of enzymes and forms a principal precursor of the pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. The encoded preproprotein is synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine where it undergoes proteolytic activation to generate a functional enzyme. This CTRB1 gene is located head-to-head with the related CTRB2 gene. Some human populations have an alternate haplotype which inverts a 16.6 Kb region containing portions of intron 1, exon 1, and the upstream sequence of the CTRB1 and CTRB2 genes. In this inversion haplotype exon 1 and flanking sequence is swapped in CTRB1 and CTRB2. This inversion is associated with differential gene expression and increased risk for chronic pancreatitis. The GRCh38 assembly represents the minor allele for SNP rs8048956 of the CTRB1 gene. SNP rs8048956 in intron 1 of the CTRB2 gene is diagnostic for this inversion. This CTRB1 gene encodes distinct isoforms, some or all of which may undergo similar processing to generate the mature protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2021]
- Pnliprp1: Predicted to enable calcium ion binding activity. Predicted to be involved in lipid catabolic process. Predicted to be located in extracellular region. Biomarker of prostate cancer. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Clps: The protein encoded by this gene is a cofactor needed by pancreatic lipase for efficient dietary lipid hydrolysis. It binds to the C-terminal, non-catalytic domain of lipase, thereby stabilizing an active conformation and considerably increasing the overall hydrophobic binding site. The gene product allows lipase to anchor noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles, counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts. This cofactor is only expressed in pancreatic acinar cells, suggesting regulation of expression by tissue-specific elements. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2011]
- Serpina6: This gene encodes an alpha-globulin protein with corticosteroid-binding properties. This is the major transport protein for glucorticoids and progestins in the blood of most vertebrates. The gene localizes to a chromosomal region containing several closely related serine protease inhibitors which may have evolved by duplication events. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ambp: This gene encodes a complex glycoprotein secreted in plasma. The precursor is proteolytically processed into distinct functioning proteins: alpha-1-microglobulin, which belongs to the superfamily of lipocalin transport proteins and may play a role in the regulation of inflammatory processes, and bikunin, which is a urinary trypsin inhibitor belonging to the superfamily of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors and plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. This gene is located on chromosome 9 in a cluster of lipocalin genes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ttr: This gene encodes one of the three prealbumins, which include alpha-1-antitrypsin, transthyretin and orosomucoid. The encoded protein, transthyretin, is a homo-tetrameric carrier protein, which transports thyroid hormones in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It is also involved in the transport of retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma by associating with retinol-binding protein. The protein may also be involved in other intracellular processes including proteolysis, nerve regeneration, autophagy and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with amyloid deposition, predominantly affecting peripheral nerves or the heart, while a small percentage of the gene mutations are non-amyloidogenic. The mutations are implicated in the etiology of several diseases, including amyloidotic polyneuropathy, euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia, amyloidotic vitreous opacities, cardiomyopathy, oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis, meningocerebrovascular amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
- Dlk1: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats that functions as a regulator of cell growth. The encoded protein is involved in the differentiation of several cell types including adipocytes. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 14 frequently showing unparental disomy, and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. A single nucleotide variant in this gene is associated with child and adolescent obesity and shows polar overdominance, where heterozygotes carrying an active paternal allele express the phenotype, while mutant homozygotes are normal. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Cela1: Elastases form a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze many proteins in addition to elastin. Humans have six elastase genes which encode the structurally similar proteins elastase 1, 2, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B. Unlike other elastases, pancreatic elastase 1 is not expressed in the pancreas. To date, elastase 1 expression has only been detected in skin keratinocytes. Clinical literature that describes human elastase 1 activity in the pancreas or fecal material is actually referring to chymotrypsin-like elastase family, member 3B. [provided by RefSeq, May 2009]

===================deepseek-r1 response =====================
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes: Cpa2, Cpa1, Ctrb1, Pnliprp1, Clps, Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr, Dlk1, Cela1.

First, I'll go through each gene and see what they do. Starting with Cpa2 and Cpa1. Both are carboxypeptidases. From the summaries, they mention these are pancreatic enzymes. Cpa1 is linked to chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. So pancreatic cells are likely involved here.

Ctrb1 is a serine protease, part of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. The summary says it's synthesized in pancreatic acinar cells. That's a strong indicator for pancreatic acinar cells.

Pnliprp1 is involved in lipid catabolic processes. The gene is a biomarker for prostate cancer, but the function is lipid breakdown, which makes me think pancreatic enzymes again, maybe lipase-related.

Clps is a cofactor for pancreatic lipase. It's specifically mentioned to be expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. So another point towards pancreatic acinar cells.

Serpina6 is a corticosteroid-binding globulin, involved in transporting glucocorticoids. This might be more liver or plasma related. Ambp is a glycoprotein in plasma, part of the lipocalin family. Ttr is transthyretin, which transports thyroid hormones and retinol, possibly liver or blood. 

Dlk1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation and is imprinted. It might relate to preadipocytes or certain stem cells. Cela1 is an elastase, but the note here says pancreatic elastase 1 isn't actually in the pancreas, but in skin keratinocytes. Wait, but the given Cela1 description says that while human pancreatic elastase 1 isn't in the pancreas, the clinical references might be to another family member. Hmm, but maybe in mice, Cela1 is expressed differently. Or maybe it's still part of pancreatic enzymes.

Putting this together: the strongest markers are Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Clps, Pnliprp1. These are all pancreatic enzymes, especially associated with acinar cells. Acinar cells produce digestive enzymes. Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr might be more hepatic or serum proteins, but since the question is about cell types, maybe other pancreatic cells? But given the concentration of pancreatic enzymes, acinar cells are the top.

Then, looking at other possibilities. Dlk1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation, but if other markers are pancreatic, maybe not. Cela1, if it's an elastase, maybe in pancreatic cells but the note says in humans it's in skin. But maybe in mice, it's different. Alternatively, pancreatic stellate cells? Or other pancreatic cell types.

Alternatively, maybe hepatocytes, but the majority of the markers are pancreatic. So top cell types would be:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells (since Ctrb1, Cpa1, Cpa2, Clps, Pnliprp1 are all there)
2. Maybe pancreatic ductal cells? But I don't see markers for that. Or maybe pancreatic beta cells, but those are insulin-producing. The markers here are all exocrine enzymes.
3. Hepatocytes? But Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr are produced in liver. So maybe a mix. But if the majority are pancreatic, perhaps the top three are all pancreatic. Alternatively, some combination.

Wait, but some markers like Serpina6 (corticosteroid-binding globulin) is produced in the liver. TTR is mainly liver-produced. Ambp is plasma. So if a cell has Ttr, Serpina6, Ambp, maybe hepatocytes. But if the cell has both pancreatic and liver markers, that's conflicting. Unless it's a mixed profile, but that's unlikely. So maybe the cell is a pancreatic acinar cell with some other markers.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of some markers from liver might indicate a different cell type, but given that the majority are pancreatic, the primary cell type is pancreatic acinar. The other markers could be secondary, but perhaps there's another cell type. For example, in the pancreas, besides acinar cells, there are endocrine cells (alpha, beta, delta, etc.), but those don't produce these enzymes. So the top three are likely all exocrine pancreatic. But maybe other exocrine types.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of Cela1 (elastase) could indicate another cell type. However, according to the note, Cela1 in humans is in skin, but maybe in mice it's different. But the user is asking about mouse cells, so I need to check. Wait, the gene summaries are from NCBI, so for mouse. Wait, the summaries are for human genes, as they mention RefSeq for human entries (e.g., "human pancreatic procarboxypeptidase"), but the task is about mouse cells. Wait, the user says "mouse cells" but the gene summaries are from human genes. So there might be some cross-species inference here. However, in mice, the homologs of these genes are likely expressed in similar cell types. For example, mouse Cpa1 and Cpa2 are also pancreatic.

So, consolidating:

Top markers: Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Clps, Pnliprp1 are all pancreatic acinar cell markers. Cela1 (if in mice it's pancreatic) would also be acinar. The others: Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr might be more liver or plasma. Dlk1 is in adipocytes or stem cells.

If the cell in question has all these markers, but the strongest are the pancreatic ones, then the top cell type is pancreatic acinar cells. The other markers might be lower expressed or maybe some are also present in other cell types. But given the combination, the cell is most likely pancreatic acinar.

Then, considering other possibilities. Are there other pancreatic cell types? For example, pancreatic centroacinar cells or ductal cells. But ductal cells typically express other markers like cytokeratins, CFTR, etc. Centroacinar cells might share some markers with acinar, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe pancreatic progenitor cells, but Dlk1 is involved in differentiation, so maybe that's a hint. Dlk1 is also associated with preadipocytes, but if combined with pancreatic markers, maybe a progenitor cell in pancreas.

But given the majority of the markers are digestive enzymes from acinar cells, the first guess is acinar. The other possibility is that there's a mix of markers from different cell types, but that's less likely. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes (due to Serpina6, Ttr, Ambp)
3. Adipocytes or preadipocytes (due to Dlk1)

But I need to check if these markers are co-expressed. Hepatocytes produce many plasma proteins, so Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr are liver-produced. However, if a cell expresses these, it's likely a hepatocyte. But if a cell has both pancreatic and liver markers, that's unusual unless it's a cell line or a mixed sample. But in normal mouse tissues, these would be separate.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is from the exocrine pancreas (acinar), and some markers like Ttr, Ambp are contaminants or low expression. But the question is to take the markers at face value. So the top three would be:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Adipocytes (due to Dlk1)

But I need to check which markers are most specific. For example, Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Clps, Pnliprp1 are very specific to acinar cells. The others might be secondary. So the top three would all be pancreatic acinar, but maybe other pancreatic cell types? Are there other exocrine cells? For example, pancreatic stellate cells, but they have different markers. Alternatively, pancreatic ductal cells, but again, different markers.

Alternatively, maybe pancreatic islet cells, but they produce hormones, not digestive enzymes. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Adipocytes

But I need to confirm if markers like Cela1 (elastase) are in acinar cells. In humans, it's in skin, but in mice, maybe it's pancreatic. For example, mouse Cela1 might be expressed in pancreas. If so, then that's another acinar marker. So the primary cell type is acinar. The other markers like Serpina6, Ttr, Ambp are more liver or plasma, so perhaps the cell is a hepatocyte, but hepatocytes wouldn't express the pancreatic enzymes. So maybe the cell is a mix, but the task is to pick the most likely cell types based on the markers. Since the majority are pancreatic, the top is acinar. Then, perhaps the other markers are less specific, but the next most prominent would be hepatocytes due to Serpina6, Ttr, Ambp. Third could be pancreatic ductal, but no specific markers here. Alternatively, maybe pancreatic endocrine cells, but no. Alternatively, since Dlk1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation, maybe adipocytes. But without more adipocyte markers, that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of Dlk1 suggests a progenitor cell, but again, not sure.

So the most confident is pancreatic acinar as #1. Then, perhaps hepatocytes as #2. For #3, maybe pancreatic stellate cells, but not sure. Alternatively, considering that Cela1 is an elastase, maybe a different type of secretory cell. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe pancreatic beta cells, but no, they don't express these enzymes.

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a combination of exocrine pancreatic and some liver or plasma, but that's not a cell type. Alternatively, maybe the markers are from a tumor cell line that expresses multiple genes.

But assuming normal mouse cells, the top three are:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Adipocytes

But I need to check if any of the other genes are more specific. For example, Serpina6 is corticosteroid-binding globulin, which is produced in the liver. TTR is mainly liver. Ambp is also liver. So if a cell has these plus pancreatic enzymes, it's conflicting. Unless it's a hepatocyte that's ectopically expressing pancreatic genes, which is unlikely. So maybe the correct approach is to focus on the majority of markers. Since Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Clps, Pnliprp1 are all acinar, which are five markers, the rest are fewer. So the top cell type is definitely acinar. Then, the remaining markers might point to other cell types, but since the question is about the same cell having all these markers, which is unlikely, maybe the answer is three types of pancreatic cells. But in the pancreas, the main exocrine cells are acinar, ductal, and centroacinar. But ductal cells have different markers. Alternatively, maybe the top three are all subtypes of pancreatic acinar cells? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the markers include some from other tissues. For example, Dlk1 is in preadipocytes, Cela1 in skin? But the user says mouse cells, but the gene summaries are human. However, in mice, Cela1 might be in the pancreas. Let me think: in mice, pancreatic elastase is Cela1? Maybe. If so, then Cela1 is another acinar marker. So with all those, the cell is definitely acinar. The other genes like Serpina6, Ttr, Ambp might be contaminants or lower expression, but if forced to pick top 3, maybe:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Pancreatic stellate cells (but no markers for that here)

Alternatively, since Dlk1 is involved in adipogenesis, maybe adipocyte progenitors. But without more markers, it's hard. Alternatively, the answer is just the top three as pancreatic acinar, then maybe pancreatic ductal, but no markers.

Alternatively, the presence of Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr could indicate a hepatocyte, but then why the pancreatic enzymes? Maybe the cell is a hepatocyte with some contamination in the data, but the task is to pick the most likely. Since most markers are acinar, the answer is:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells

But the question asks for top 3. Maybe the other two are less likely. For example, pancreatic beta cells (unlikely), hepatocytes, or adipocytes. But given the markers, the top three would be:

Pancreatic acinar cells, Hepatocytes, and Adipocytes. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the presence of Clps, which is a cofactor for pancreatic lipase, and Pnliprp1 (pancreatic lipase-related) could indicate pancreatic acinar. Ctrb1 is chymotrypsin B, also pancreatic. So the strongest is acinar. The other markers might be from other cell types, but if we have to list the top 3 cell types that these markers could indicate, considering each marker's association, then perhaps:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells (Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Clps, Pnliprp1, Cela1)
2. Hepatocytes (Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr)
3. Adipocytes or preadipocytes (Dlk1)

But the user wants the top 3 cell types of the same cell. If the cell expresses all these markers, it's more likely a mix, but in reality, these markers are from different cell types. However, the task is to infer the most likely cell type based on the markers provided. Maybe the user expects the primary cell type is pancreatic acinar, and the others are lower probability. But how to get three cell types? Maybe:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Pancreatic ductal cells (though no specific markers here)
3. Hepatocytes

But without ductal markers, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe pancreatic islet cells, but no. Alternatively, the presence of Dlk1 could indicate a mesenchymal stem cell or progenitor cell. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a pancreatic cell with some hepatic characteristics, but that's not a standard cell type.

Alternatively, maybe the top three are all pancreatic-related. For example:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Pancreatic centroacinar cells
3. Pancreatic progenitor cells

But I don't have markers for centroacinar or progenitors here. 

Given the information, the most confident is pancreatic acinar as #1. Then, the remaining markers might point to liver and adipose, so #2 Hepatocytes, #3 Adipocytes. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some sources might group Serpina6 with liver, Ttr with liver/choroid plexus, Ambp with liver/plasma. Dlk1 with adipose or stem cells. Cela1 with pancreas or skin. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Adipocytes

But I need to check if any of the other genes are more specific. For example, Ttr is also produced in the choroid plexus, but that's brain. Ambp is in plasma. Serpina6 is liver. So the second cell type with those three markers would be hepatocytes. Third, Dlk1 suggests adipocyte progenitors. So the answer would be:

Pancreatic acinar cells, Hepatocytes, Adipocytes

But I need to make sure that in the context of mouse cells, these markers are indeed expressed in those cell types. For example, in mice, Dlk1 is expressed in preadipocytes and some stem cells. Cela1, if it's pancreatic in mice, then acinar. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects all three to be pancreatic cell types, but I can't think of three different pancreatic cell types with these markers. So perhaps the answer is:

Pancreatic acinar cells, Hepatocytes, Pancreatic stellate cells

But without stellate cell markers, that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is only pancreatic acinar cells, but the user wants three. Maybe there's another angle. Let me think again.

Another approach: look up marker genes for mouse cell types.

Pancreatic acinar cells: CPA1, CPA2, CTRB1, CLPS, PNLIPRP1, CELA1 are all known markers.

Hepatocytes: ALB (albumin), but Serpina6 (CBG), Ambp (AMBP), TTR are produced by hepatocytes.

Adipocytes: DLK1 is a marker of preadipocytes.

So, the markers given include several for acinar cells, several for hepatocytes, and one for preadipocytes. If the cell has all these markers, which is unlikely, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided, then:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells (majority of markers)
2. Hepatocytes (next set of markers)
3. Adipocytes (due to DLK1)

So the answer would be: Pancreatic acinar cells, Hepatocytes, Adipocytes

But I need to make sure that the presence of these markers in a single cell is possible. In reality, a single cell wouldn't express all these, but perhaps in a mixed sample or the question is considering the presence of these markers in a dataset. However, the user asks for the most likely cell types, so the top 3 are based on the number of markers pointing to each cell type.

So, ranking by number of markers:

- Pancreatic acinar: Cpa1, Cpa2, Ctrb1, Pnliprp1, Clps, Cela1 (6 markers)
- Hepatocytes: Serpina6, Ambp, Ttr (3 markers)
- Adipocytes: Dlk1 (1 marker)

Thus, top 3:

1. Pancreatic acinar cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Adipocytes

But the user might expect more specific terms. For example, in the pancreas, acinar cells are one, then perhaps pancreatic ductal or something else. But given the markers, the answer is as above.
