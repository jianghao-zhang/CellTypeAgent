Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Hsd3b1: The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta-5-3-beta-hydroxysteroid precursors into delta-4-ketosteroids, which leads to the production of all classes of steroid hormones. The encoded protein also catalyzes the interconversion of 3-beta-hydroxy- and 3-keto-5-alpha-androstane steroids. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2016]
- Cyp11a1: This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the steroid hormones. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The cellular location of the smaller isoform is unclear since it lacks the mitochondrial-targeting transit peptide. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Fdx1: This gene encodes a small iron-sulfur protein that transfers electrons from NADPH through ferredoxin reductase to mitochondrial cytochrome P450, involved in steroid, vitamin D, and bile acid metabolism. Pseudogenes of this functional gene are found on chromosomes 20 and 21. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Akr1cl: Gene ID not found
- Sfrp4: Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a member of the SFRP family that contains a cysteine-rich domain homologous to the putative Wnt-binding site of Frizzled proteins. SFRPs act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling. The expression of SFRP4 in ventricular myocardium correlates with apoptosis related gene expression. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ephx2: This gene encodes a member of the epoxide hydrolase family. The protein, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding dihydrodiols. Mutations in this gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]
- Mgarp: Predicted to be involved in several processes, including axonal transport; cellular response to hormone stimulus; and protein targeting to mitochondrion. Located in mitochondrion. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Idh1: Isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP(+)-dependent isozyme is a homodimer. The protein encoded by this gene is the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. It contains the PTS-1 peroxisomal targeting signal sequence. The presence of this enzyme in peroxisomes suggests roles in the regeneration of NADPH for intraperoxisomal reductions, such as the conversion of 2, 4-dienoyl-CoAs to 3-enoyl-CoAs, as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2-oxoglutarate, namely the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanic acid. The cytoplasmic enzyme serves a significant role in cytoplasmic NADPH production. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]
- Lhcgr: This gene encodes the receptor for both luteinizing hormone and choriogonadotropin. This receptor belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family, and its activity is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase. Mutations in this gene result in disorders of male secondary sexual character development, including familial male precocious puberty, also known as testotoxicosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Leydig cell adenoma with precocious puberty, and male pseudohermaphtoditism with Leydig cell hypoplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Scarb1: The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma membrane receptor for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). The encoded protein mediates cholesterol transfer to and from HDL. In addition, this protein is a receptor for hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2 and facilitates cell entry by the virus, SARS-CoV2. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2021]

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. They provided a list of genes with their summaries from NCBI, and the task is to figure out which cell types these markers are associated with, then rank them by probability.

First, I'll go through each gene and note their functions to see what cell types they might be involved in. Let's start with Hsd3b1. The description says it's involved in steroid hormone production. That makes me think of cells that produce steroids, like adrenal or gonadal cells. Then there's Cyp11a1, which is also involved in converting cholesterol to pregnenolone, a key step in steroidogenesis. Fdx1 transfers electrons in mitochondrial cytochrome P450 systems, which are crucial for steroid synthesis as well. So these three genes (Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Fdx1) all point towards steroid-producing cells.

Next, Lhcgr is the receptor for luteinizing hormone and chorionic gonadotropin. Luteinizing hormone is important in the testes and ovaries. For example, Leydig cells in the testes respond to LH to produce testosterone. Scarb1 is involved in cholesterol uptake, which is essential for steroid hormone-producing cells since cholesterol is the precursor for steroids. So Leydig cells might be a candidate here.

Looking at Sfrp4, it's involved in Wnt signaling and apoptosis. This gene is mentioned to be expressed in ventricular myocardium, but that's in the context of apoptosis. However, Sfrp4 is also known to be expressed in certain ovarian cells or other steroidogenic tissues. Ephx2 is an epoxide hydrolase linked to cholesterol metabolism. Idh1 is involved in cytoplasmic NADPH production, which is important for cells that need a lot of redox reactions, like steroid-producing cells.

Akr1cl wasn't found in the database, but other AKR family members might be involved in steroid metabolism. Mgarp is involved in mitochondrial targeting, which again ties to cells with high mitochondrial activity, such as those producing steroids.

Putting this all together, the strongest indicators are Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Fdx1, Lhcgr, and Scarb1. All of these are highly associated with steroid hormone synthesis. Leydig cells in the testes are a primary site for testosterone production and express these markers. Similarly, theca cells in the ovaries produce androgens and would have similar markers. Adrenal cortical cells also produce steroids like cortisol and aldosterone. 

The presence of Lhcgr specifically points towards Leydig and theca cells because they respond to LH. Scarb1's role in cholesterol uptake is critical for steroidogenic cells. While adrenal cells do produce steroids, they might not express Lhcgr as prominently as gonadal cells. Therefore, the top three cell types would likely be Leydig cells first, then theca cells, followed by adrenal cortical cells. 

I need to confirm if other markers like Sfrp4 or Ephx2 are also expressed in these cell types. Sfrp4 in some contexts is found in granulosa cells or other ovarian cells, but combined with the other markers here, Leydig and theca seem more likely. Adrenal cortex cells would have the steroidogenic enzymes but not Lhcgr, which is more gonadal. So the ranking would be Leydig cells, theca cells, adrenal cortical cells. Alternatively, maybe granulosa cells instead of theca? But Hsd3b1 and Cyp11a1 are more theca or Leydig. Granulosa cells typically produce estradiol using aromatase, which isn't listed here. 

Another thought: Sertoli cells in the testes are involved in supporting spermatogenesis but might not express these steroidogenic enzymes. So yes, Leydig cells are the top. Then theca cells, then adrenal cortical. So the final answer would be Leydig cells, Theca cells, Adrenal cortical cells.
