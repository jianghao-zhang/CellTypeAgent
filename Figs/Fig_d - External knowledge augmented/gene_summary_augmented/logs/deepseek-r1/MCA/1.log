Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Mylk: This gene, a muscle member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, encodes myosin light chain kinase which is a calcium/calmodulin dependent enzyme. This kinase phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chains to facilitate myosin interaction with actin filaments to produce contractile activity. This gene encodes both smooth muscle and nonmuscle isoforms. In addition, using a separate promoter in an intron in the 3' region, it encodes telokin, a small protein identical in sequence to the C-terminus of myosin light chain kinase, that is independently expressed in smooth muscle and functions to stabilize unphosphorylated myosin filaments. A pseudogene is located on the p arm of chromosome 3. Four transcript variants that produce four isoforms of the calcium/calmodulin dependent enzyme have been identified as well as two transcripts that produce two isoforms of telokin. Additional variants have been identified but lack full length transcripts. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Acta2: This gene encodes one of six different actin proteins. Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in cell motility, structure, integrity, and intercellular signaling. The encoded protein is a smooth muscle actin that is involved in vascular contractility and blood pressure homeostasis. Mutations in this gene cause a variety of vascular diseases, such as thoracic aortic disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, and Moyamoya disease, as well as multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2017]
- Myl9: Myosin, a structural component of muscle, consists of two heavy chains and four light chains. The protein encoded by this gene is a myosin light chain that may regulate muscle contraction by modulating the ATPase activity of myosin heads. The encoded protein binds calcium and is activated by myosin light chain kinase. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Mdk: This gene encodes a member of a small family of secreted growth factors that binds heparin and responds to retinoic acid. The encoded protein promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, in particular during tumorigenesis. This gene has been targeted as a therapeutic for a variety of different disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]
- Cdkn1c: This gene is imprinted, with preferential expression of the maternal allele. The encoded protein is a tight-binding, strong inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene are implicated in sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndorome, suggesting that this gene is a tumor suppressor candidate. Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2010]
- Ptn: The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted heparin-binding growth factor. The protein has significant roles in cell growth and survival, cell migration, angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]
- Dlk1: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats that functions as a regulator of cell growth. The encoded protein is involved in the differentiation of several cell types including adipocytes. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 14 frequently showing unparental disomy, and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. A single nucleotide variant in this gene is associated with child and adolescent obesity and shows polar overdominance, where heterozygotes carrying an active paternal allele express the phenotype, while mutant homozygotes are normal. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Itm2a: This gene encodes a type II membrane protein that belongs to the ITM2 family. Studies in mouse suggest that it may be involved in osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2010]
- Meg3: This gene is a maternally expressed imprinted gene. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been transcribed from this gene and all of them are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This gene is expressed in many normal tissues, but its expression is lost in multiple cancer cell lines of various tissue origins. It inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro. It also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, and regulates p53 target gene expression. Its deletion enhances angiogenesis in vivo. Many experimental evidences demonstrate that this gene is a lncRNA tumor suppressor. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]
- Mfap2: Microfibrillar-associated protein 2 is a major antigen of elastin-associated microfibrils and a candidate for involvement in the etiology of inherited connective tissue diseases. Four transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]

<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on these markers: Mylk, Acta2, Myl9, Mdk, Cdkn1c, Ptn, Dlk1, Itm2a, Meg3, Mfap2.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall their associated cell types.

Starting with Mylk: The summary mentions it's a muscle gene, specifically smooth muscle and nonmuscle isoforms. So smooth muscle cells are a candidate. Also, myosin light chain kinase is involved in muscle contraction.

Acta2: This is alpha-smooth muscle actin, a classic marker for smooth muscle cells. So that reinforces smooth muscle.

Myl9: Another myosin light chain, which is involved in muscle contraction. Again, points to smooth muscle.

Mdk: Midkine, a growth factor involved in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Maybe endothelial cells or some kind of progenitor cells. Also, sometimes expressed in macrophages or during development.

Cdkn1c: This is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, imprinted gene. It's involved in cell cycle arrest. Expressed in certain stem cells or placental cells. Also associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, so maybe some embryonic tissues.

Ptn: Pleiotrophin, another heparin-binding growth factor. Expressed in neural cells, maybe astrocytes or during development. Also found in some tumors.

Dlk1: Delta-like homolog 1, involved in adipocyte differentiation. It's imprinted, paternal allele expressed. Found in preadipocytes, stromal cells, maybe some endocrine cells.

Itm2a: Integral membrane protein 2A, involved in osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation. So possibly osteoblasts or chondrocytes.

Meg3: Maternally expressed gene 3, a lncRNA tumor suppressor. Expressed in various tissues but lost in cancers. Maybe certain stem cells or specific tissue progenitors.

Mfap2: Microfibrillar-associated protein 2, part of elastin-associated microfibrils. Found in connective tissues, fibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells (since elastin is in vessels).

Putting this together: The strong presence of smooth muscle markers (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, maybe Mfap2) suggests smooth muscle cells as the top. Then, other markers might indicate other cell types. Mdk and Ptn could be endothelial cells or pericytes (which are related to smooth muscle). Dlk1 is adipocyte-related, but Cdkn1c and Meg3 might point towards some progenitor or stem cells. Itm2a could be osteoblast or chondrocyte. However, given the overlap of multiple smooth muscle markers, that's likely first. Then, maybe fibroblasts or pericytes (since they have some similar markers). Alternatively, considering Mdk, Ptn, and Dlk1, perhaps a stromal cell type?

Wait, smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9), then vascular smooth muscle? Or maybe fibroblasts. But fibroblasts have markers like Acta2 (myofibroblasts), but also other markers. Alternatively, pericytes share some smooth muscle markers. Another thought: Mfap2 is in microfibrils, which are in elastic tissues, so maybe vascular smooth muscle cells. Then, endothelial cells might have Mdk and Ptn. But endothelial cells usually have markers like CD31, VEGFR2. Maybe not. Alternatively, some of the other genes might indicate mesenchymal stem cells. Dlk1 is in preadipocytes, so maybe adipocyte precursors. But Cdkn1c is involved in cell cycle arrest, maybe in quiescent cells. Meg3 is a tumor suppressor lncRNA, perhaps in stem cells.

Alternatively, looking for the most common cell types associated with these markers. Acta2 is definitely smooth muscle. Mylk and Myl9 are also muscle-related. So smooth muscle cell is number 1. Then, Mdk and Ptn are growth factors, maybe associated with endothelial cells or certain stromal cells. Mfap2 is in connective tissue, so fibroblasts. So maybe fibroblasts as second. Third could be pericytes, which have some smooth muscle markers. Alternatively, considering Itm2a (osteoblast/chondrocyte) and Dlk1 (adipocyte), maybe mesenchymal stem cells which can differentiate into these lineages. But which markers are more dominant?

Alternatively, Cdkn1c and Meg3 are imprinted genes involved in growth regulation. Cdkn1c is expressed in placenta and some stem cells. Meg3 is in various tissues. Maybe a progenitor cell type. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, some of these markers are found in vascular smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, Mfap2), so that's a strong first. Then, maybe fibroblasts (Mfap2, maybe some others). Third could be pericytes, which are similar to smooth muscle. Alternatively, since Mdk and Ptn are also expressed in some neural cells, but that seems less likely unless it's a glial cell. But I think the strongest indicators are for smooth muscle. Then, perhaps fibroblasts and then mesenchymal stem cells or pericytes.

Alternatively, another approach: check each gene's typical cell types.

- Acta2: Smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts.
- Mylk: Smooth muscle, non-muscle cells (like endothelial? But mainly smooth muscle).
- Myl9: Smooth muscle.
- Mdk: Endothelial cells, macrophages, some cancers.
- Cdkn1c: Placenta, certain stem cells, imprinted.
- Ptn: Neural cells, endothelial, some stromal.
- Dlk1: Preadipocytes, adrenal gland, stromal cells.
- Itm2a: Osteoblasts, chondrocytes.
- Meg3: Various, but tumor suppressor in many cells.
- Mfap2: Fibroblasts, smooth muscle (elastin).

So combining, the top markers (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9) are all smooth muscle. Mfap2 also supports that. So smooth muscle cell is first. Then, maybe fibroblasts (since Mfap2 is in fibroblasts, and Acta2 can be myofibroblasts). But Mfap2 is also in smooth muscle. Alternatively, if multiple smooth muscle markers are present, that's the top. Then, perhaps vascular endothelial cells (Mdk, Ptn), but without classic endothelial markers like CD31, maybe not. Alternatively, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which can express various markers, including Dlk1, Itm2a, etc. But which markers are more specific?

Alternatively, looking for cell types that commonly co-express these. For example, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) express Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, and Mfap2. Then, maybe pericytes (which are similar to SMCs) as second? But they share many markers. Alternatively, myofibroblasts, which have Acta2. Third could be fibroblasts, but not sure. Alternatively, considering other markers: Cdkn1c and Meg3 are involved in cell cycle regulation. If the cells are proliferating or quiescent, but maybe in stem cells. Dlk1 is in adipocyte precursors, so maybe adipose stromal cells. However, without more specific markers, the strongest signals are for smooth muscle. Then, perhaps fibroblasts (Mfap2, maybe some others). Third could be mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which have a mix of markers like Dlk1, Itm2a, etc. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another angle: Mdk and Ptn are both heparin-binding growth factors involved in angiogenesis. So maybe endothelial progenitor cells or activated endothelial cells. But again, typical endothelial markers are missing. So maybe not. Alternatively, some cancer cells, but the question is about normal mouse cells.

Putting it all together, the most confident is smooth muscle cells as #1. Then, maybe fibroblasts (Acta2 in myofibroblasts, Mfap2). Third could be pericytes, which are closely related to smooth muscle. Alternatively, mesenchymal stem cells. Another possibility is stromal cells from adipose tissue (given Dlk1), but that might be more specific. Alternatively, considering Itm2a for osteoblasts, but that seems less likely unless there's a bone cell type here.

But given the markers provided, smooth muscle is clear. For the second, maybe fibroblasts. Third, perhaps pericytes. Alternatively, looking for cell types that commonly have Mdk, Ptn, Dlk1, etc. Maybe some type of progenitor or stromal cell. However, without more specific markers, the top three based on the strongest markers (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9) would be smooth muscle cells, then fibroblasts, then perhaps pericytes. Alternatively, vascular smooth muscle cells, then myofibroblasts, then mesenchymal stem cells.

Alternatively, looking up common cell type markers:

- Smooth muscle cells: Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, Mfap2
- Fibroblasts: Mfap2, maybe others
- Pericytes: Acta2, Mylk, Pdgfrb (not listed here)
- Mesenchymal stem cells: Dlk1, Itm2a, others
- Adipocytes: Dlk1 (preadipocytes)
- Osteoblasts: Itm2a
- Endothelial cells: Mdk, Ptn, but usually other markers like Pecam1 (not here)

So given that, the top three would be:

1. Smooth muscle cells
2. Fibroblasts (especially myofibroblasts due to Acta2)
3. Mesenchymal stem cells (due to Dlk1, Itm2a, Cdkn1c, Meg3)

Alternatively, pericytes as second, but they might share markers with SMCs. Fibroblasts as third. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that some markers point towards stromal cells in the bone marrow or adipose tissue. But given the information, I think the most logical top three are smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells.
