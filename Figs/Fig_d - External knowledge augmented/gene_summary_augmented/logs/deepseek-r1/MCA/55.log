Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Dynlrb2: Predicted to enable dynein intermediate chain binding activity. Predicted to be involved in microtubule-based movement. Predicted to be located in ciliary tip. Predicted to be part of cytoplasmic dynein complex. Predicted to be active in centrosome and cytoplasm. Biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Scgb1a1: This gene encodes a member of the secretoglobin family of small secreted proteins. The encoded protein has been implicated in numerous functions including anti-inflammation, inhibition of phospholipase A2 and the sequestering of hydrophobic ligands. Defects in this gene are associated with a susceptibility to asthma. [provided by RefSeq, May 2010]
- Cyp2f2: Gene ID not found
- Scgb3a2: The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted lung surfactant protein and a downstream target of thyroid transcription factor. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of this gene results in susceptibility to asthma.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]
- Riiad1: Summary not found
- Ccdc153: Enables identical protein binding activity. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Tmem212: Predicted to be integral component of membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Mt3: This gene is a member of the metallothionein family of genes. Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions. This gene family member displays tissue-specific expression, and contains a threonine insert near its N-terminus and a glutamate-rich hexapeptide insert near its C-terminus relative to the proteins encoded by other gene family members. It plays an important role in zinc and copper homeostasis, and is induced under hypoxic conditions. The encoded protein is a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the provided marker genes. Let's start by going through each gene and see what cell types they're associated with.

First, Dynlrb2. The summary mentions it's part of the cytoplasmic dynein complex and involved in microtubule-based movement. Also located in the ciliary tip. Dyneins are often found in cells with cilia or flagella. So maybe cells with motile cilia, like those in the respiratory tract or ependymal cells. 

Next, Scgb1a1. This is a secretoglobin family member. I remember that Scgb1a1 is also known as CCSP (Clara cell secretory protein) or CC10. Clara cells are found in the bronchioles of the lungs. So this marker is likely specific to Clara cells, which are non-ciliated secretory cells in the airway epithelium.

Cyp2f2. The gene ID wasn't found, but I recall that Cyp2f2 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme expressed in Club cells (another name for Clara cells) in the mouse lung. So this reinforces the Clara cell possibility.

Scgb3a2 is another secretoglobin. From the description, it's a secreted lung surfactant protein and linked to asthma. Surfactant proteins are typically associated with alveolar type II cells, but Scgb3a2 might be more specific to Club cells as well. Alternatively, maybe other secretory cells in the lung.

Riiad1: No summary found, so not much to go on here. Maybe look up if it's known in any specific cell types. But without info, hard to tell. Maybe skip for now.

Ccdc153: Involved in identical protein binding. Coiled-coil domain proteins are often involved in cilia or flagella. Ccdc153 might be part of the axoneme structure in ciliated cells. So again, pointing towards ciliated epithelial cells.

Tmem212: Integral membrane protein. Transmembrane proteins can be involved in various functions, but some TMEMs are associated with cilia. For example, TMEM212 is involved in ciliogenesis. So another hint towards ciliated cells.

Mt3: Metallothionein 3. This is linked to metal ion binding and mentioned in the brain, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. Metallothioneins are expressed in various tissues, including astrocytes and other glial cells. However, Mt3 is also found in certain epithelia, maybe in the lung? Not sure. Alternatively, could it be in neurons or glia?

Lrrc23: Leucine-rich repeat-containing 23. Predicted to be in cytosol. Not much info here. Maybe check if it's known in specific cells. Maybe immune cells? Not sure.

Fam183b: Located in cytoplasm and cytoskeleton, active in ciliary base. Again, this is another cilia-related gene. So ciliated cells again.

Putting this together: The strongest markers here are Scgb1a1 (Clara cells) and Cyp2f2 (also Club/Clara cells). Then Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b all point towards ciliated cells. Scgb3a2 is another secretoglobin in the lung, possibly Club cells or another secretory type. Mt3 might be a bit of a wild card, but if other markers are strong for lung, maybe it's part of that. 

So the top cell types would likely be:

1. Club cells (Clara cells) because of Scgb1a1 and Cyp2f2.

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (like those in the trachea or bronchus) due to Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b.

3. Maybe another lung cell type, like alveolar type II cells? But Scgb3a2 is mentioned as a surfactant protein. Wait, surfactant proteins are usually SP-A, SP-B, etc., produced by alveolar type II cells. However, Scgb3a2 is a secretoglobin, not a surfactant protein per se. Alternatively, maybe bronchiolar secretory cells. Alternatively, maybe goblet cells? But Scgb1a1 is more Club cells. 

Alternatively, Scgb3a2 might be in another type of secretory cell. Maybe in the trachea or submucosal glands. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if Scgb3a2 is a marker for a subset of Club cells or another airway secretory cell. 

Alternatively, considering the cilia-related genes, maybe ependymal cells, which have cilia and are in the brain. But the presence of lung-specific markers like Scgb1a1 and Cyp2f2 would point more towards respiratory epithelial cells.

Wait, the user mentioned mouse cells. So in mouse lung, the main epithelial cell types are ciliated cells, Club cells, goblet cells (less common unless in certain conditions), basal cells, and alveolar cells. 

Given the markers, the top three would be:

1. Club cells (Scgb1a1, Cyp2f2)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b)

3. Maybe another type like alveolar type II, but Scgb3a2's description says it's a secreted lung surfactant protein. Wait, Scgb3a2 (secretoglobin 3A2) is also known as Uteroglobin-related protein 1 (UGRP1), which is expressed in the lung, specifically in Clara cells and possibly other secretory cells. So maybe Scgb3a2 is also a Club cell marker. If that's the case, then Club cells are even more likely as the top. Then the second would be ciliated cells. Third, perhaps another cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe some of these genes are present in other ciliated cells outside the lung, like in the oviduct or trachea. But given the lung-specific markers (Scgb1a1, Cyp2f2, Scgb3a2), the context is likely lung epithelium. 

So the top three cell types would be:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (respiratory tract)

3. Maybe alveolar type II cells, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe another secretory cell type. Alternatively, maybe goblet cells, but the markers don't include MUC5AC or other goblet markers. Alternatively, considering Mt3 (metallothionein 3) is expressed in certain neurons or glia, but that would be conflicting with the other lung markers. So maybe the third is a different lung cell type. Alternatively, if Mt3 is in the lung, maybe a type of bronchial epithelial cell. Alternatively, maybe neuroendocrine cells, but I don't see specific markers for that here. 

Alternatively, the third could be a combination of other ciliated cells, but since the first two are Club and ciliated, maybe the third is another type. Wait, Riiad1 and Lrrc23 are not informative. Fam183b is ciliary base, so again ciliated. Maybe the third is a different ciliated cell type, but in mouse, most ciliated cells in the respiratory tract are similar. Alternatively, maybe ependymal cells, but again, conflicting with lung markers. 

Alternatively, considering that some of these genes are involved in cilia function across different tissues, perhaps the third cell type is spermatogenic cells (sperm have flagella, which are similar to cilia), but the presence of lung-specific markers makes that less likely. 

So given all this, the top three cell types are most likely:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (tracheal/bronchial)

3. Maybe alveolar type II cells if Scgb3a2 is considered a surfactant-related protein, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another secretory cell type. Alternatively, given that Scgb3a2 is a secretoglobin and downstream of thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1 or NKX2-1), which is expressed in lung epithelial cells, maybe it's another type of secretory cell in the airway. Alternatively, maybe the third is a subset of Club cells, but that's not a distinct cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cell type that co-expresses both secretory and ciliated markers, but that's unlikely. So perhaps the third is another ciliated cell type. Wait, but the user asks for the top 3 cell types. If the markers are a mix of Club and ciliated, then the third might be a different cell type that also has some of these markers. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different cell type with Mt3 expression. Mt3 is linked to metallothioneins, which are expressed in astrocytes, but that would be in the brain, conflicting with other markers. Alternatively, maybe in the liver (as Dynlrb2 is a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma), but the presence of lung markers suggests the primary context is lung. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third cell type is a hepatocyte due to Dynlrb2 being a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, but the other markers are mostly lung. That might split the ranking. But if the majority of markers point to lung, then liver cells would be less likely. 

Given all this, the top two are clear: Club cells and ciliated epithelial cells. The third is a bit tricky. Scgb3a2 might be another marker for Club cells, so perhaps the third is another cell type. Alternatively, since some genes like Mt3 are in the brain, but that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the third is basal cells, but there's no specific markers here. 

Alternatively, looking up Riiad1: Quick search in my mind... Riiad1 is a protein-coding gene, but I don't recall its specific cell type. Maybe it's expressed in ciliated cells. 

Given that, maybe the third cell type is another type of ciliated cell, but I think the answer would be:

Club cells, ciliated epithelial cells, and possibly another lung epithelial cell type like alveolar type II, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is a combination of genes leading to another cell type. Alternatively, given that some of the cilia-related genes (Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b) are also found in sperm cells, but again, the presence of lung markers makes that less likely. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is ependymal cells (which have cilia), but again, the lung markers would conflict. 

In conclusion, the top three cell types are most likely:

1. Club cells (Clara cells) – due to Scgb1a1 and Cyp2f2.

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (respiratory tract) – due to Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b.

3. Alveolar type II cells – if Scgb3a2 is considered a surfactant protein, but I think Scgb3a2 is more associated with Club cells. Alternatively, maybe another secretory cell type. Alternatively, maybe goblet cells, but no goblet markers here. 

Alternatively, if Scgb3a2 is a separate marker, maybe the third is another secretory cell type in the airway. 

But given the information, the safest top three would be:

1. Club cells

2. Ciliated epithelial cells

3. Maybe bronchial epithelial cells (a broader category), but since the user wants specific names, perhaps alveolar type II is not correct. Alternatively, maybe the third is another ciliated cell type. Alternatively, the third could be a different tissue's ciliated cells, but given the context, sticking to lung.

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a combination of other markers. For example, Mt3 might be expressed in some lung cells. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a lung neuroendocrine cell, but there's no specific markers here. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:

Club cells, Ciliated epithelial cells, and then maybe another type like alveolar type II, but given Scgb3a2's description as a surfactant protein downstream of TTF-1, which is expressed in alveolar type II cells, maybe that's the third. So:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells

3. Alveolar type II cells

Alternatively, if Scgb3a2 is more specific to Club cells, then maybe the third is another cell type. But I think Scgb3a2 is in Club cells. So perhaps the third is another type, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the third is a different cell type in another organ. But given the majority of markers are lung, I think the third is alveolar type II. 

Wait, the Scgb3a2 description says it's a secreted lung surfactant protein. Surfactant is produced by alveolar type II cells. But Scgb3a2 is part of the secretoglobin family, which is different from the surfactant proteins (SP-A, B, C, D). So maybe Scgb3a2 is produced by Club cells instead. Then, alveolar type II cells wouldn't be the third. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a different cell type. Given that Mt3 is linked to metallothionein and possibly brain cells, but other markers are lung, maybe it's a stretch. 

Alternatively, considering Fam183b and Ccdc153, which are involved in cilia, maybe the third is a multiciliated cell type, but that's already covered in ciliated epithelial cells. 

Hmm. This is a bit challenging. Given that the user wants the top 3, and the first two are Club and ciliated, the third might be a stretch. But perhaps there's another cell type. 

Wait, looking back at Dynlrb2: it's a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma. So maybe hepatocytes could be a possibility, but the other markers are lung. Unless it's a mixed sample, but the user is asking for mouse cells, perhaps a specific tissue. But since most markers are lung, maybe hepatocytes are less likely. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a cell type in the trachea, which has both Club and ciliated cells. But that's already covered. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a pulmonary neuroendocrine cell, but again, no specific markers here. 

Alternatively, given that Mt3 is expressed in astrocytes, but that's conflicting. 

I think the safest answer is:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells (respiratory)

3. Alveolar type II cells (if Scgb3a2 is considered a surfactant-related protein)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is another Club cell subtype. 

Alternatively, given that some of the cilia genes are also found in sperm, but the other markers don't support that. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a different ciliated cell type like ependymal cells, but again, conflicting markers. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a bronchiolar epithelial cell, but that's a general category. 

Given all this, I think the top three are:

Club cells, Ciliated epithelial cells, and Alveolar type II cells. 

But I need to verify if Scgb3a2 is indeed in alveolar type II. Alternatively, if Scgb3a2 is a Club cell marker. 

Upon checking (in my mind), Scgb3a2 (secretoglobin 3A2) is expressed in Club cells of the airway, not alveolar type II. So alveolar type II cells produce surfactant proteins like SP-C, while Scgb3a2 is another secretoglobin. Therefore, Scgb3a2 is likely another marker for Club cells. So then, the third cell type might be something else. 

But then, what's left? If the third cell type is not alveolar, maybe another secretory cell. Alternatively, the third could be a different cell type altogether. 

Alternatively, considering that some of the cilia genes (like Dynlrb2, Ccdc153) are part of the dynein complex, which is important in cilia movement. So ciliated cells in the respiratory tract. But that's already the second cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a multiciliated cell type, but that's the same as the second. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a different tissue's ciliated cells. But the presence of lung markers (Scgb1a1, Cyp2f2, Scgb3a2) suggests the main tissue is lung. 

So perhaps the third cell type is basal cells of the airway epithelium. But there's no specific basal cell markers here (like KRT5 or TP63). 

Alternatively, maybe goblet cells, but again, no MUC5AC or other markers. 

Alternatively, the third could be a rare cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a combination of genes leading to a different conclusion. 

But given the information, perhaps the top three are:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells

3. Bronchiolar epithelial cells (a broader category, but not sure)

Alternatively, given that some genes like Mt3 are expressed in other tissues, but in the context of the other markers, perhaps the third is a hepatocyte due to Dynlrb2's link to hepatocellular carcinoma. But that seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a pulmonary ionocyte, but I don't think the markers here are specific for that. 

Alternatively, given that some markers are involved in cilia (Dynlrb2, Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b), perhaps the third is ependymal cells, but again, the lung markers are dominant. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is just the top two, but the user asked for three. So perhaps the third is a stretch. 

Alternatively, considering that Mt3 is expressed in astrocytes, but that's not consistent with other markers. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a different type of secretory cell in the lung. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a progenitor cell type. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. 

Given the markers, the strongest are Club and ciliated. The third is perhaps Alveolar type II, even if Scgb3a2 isn't a perfect fit. Or maybe the third is a general epithelial cell. 

Alternatively, another approach: check which cell types express these markers. 

Looking up in my mind:

- Scgb1a1 (CCSP) is a definitive Club cell marker.

- Cyp2f2 is also a Club cell marker in mice.

- Scgb3a2 is expressed in Club cells and possibly other secretory cells.

- Dynlrb2 is involved in cilia, so ciliated cells.

- Ccdc153, Tmem212, Fam183b: cilia-related, so ciliated cells.

- Mt3: Could be in various cells, including astrocytes, but in the lung, maybe in certain epithelial cells.

So the third cell type might not have strong markers here. But given the presence of Mt3, maybe it's a type of glial cell? But that's conflicting with lung markers. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a hepatocyte (due to Dynlrb2's link to hepatocellular carcinoma), but again, other markers are lung. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a pulmonary neuroendocrine cell, but without specific markers like Ascl1 or Cgrp, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of immune cell, but there's no immune-specific markers here. 

Given the information, the third cell type is unclear, but the user requires three. So perhaps the answer is:

Club cells, Ciliated epithelial cells, and Alveolar type II cells.

Alternatively, Club cells, Ciliated cells, and another ciliated cell type. 

Alternatively, given that some genes are associated with cilia base (Fam183b) and tip (Dynlrb2), maybe the third is a different ciliated cell type, but I think they are all part of the same cell type. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a multiciliated cell, but that's the same as the second. 

In conclusion, I think the top three are:

1. Club cells (Clara cells)

2. Ciliated epithelial cells

3. Alveolar type II cells

But I'm not entirely confident about the third. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different cell type like bronchial epithelial cells, but that's too vague. 

Another possibility: Scgb3a2 is also known as UGRP1, which is expressed in the lung and thyroid. But thyroid cells aren't indicated here. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a tracheal epithelial cell, but that's covered under ciliated and Club cells. 

Perhaps the answer is:

Club cells, Ciliated epithelial cells, and Bronchiolar epithelial cells.

But I think the user expects specific cell type names. 

Alternatively, considering that some markers are found in the ciliary tip and base, maybe the third is a specific type of ciliated cell, like motile ciliated cells. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a lung type I cell, but there's no specific markers here for that. 

Given all this, I'll proceed with the top three as:

Club cells, Ciliated epithelial cells, and Alveolar type II cells.
