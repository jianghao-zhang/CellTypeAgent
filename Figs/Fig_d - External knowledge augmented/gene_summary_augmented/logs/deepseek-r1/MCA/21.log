Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Stra8: This gene encodes a retinoic acid-responsive protein. A homologous protein in mouse has been shown to be involved in the regulation of meiotic initiation in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis, though feature differences between the mouse and human proteins suggest that these homologs are not entirely functionally equivalent. It is thought that this gene may play a role in spermatogenesis in humans. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]
- Dazl: The DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) gene family encodes potential RNA binding proteins that are expressed in prenatal and postnatal germ cells of males and females. The protein encoded by this gene is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm of fetal germ cells and to the cytoplasm of developing oocytes. In the testis, this protein is localized to the nucleus of spermatogonia but relocates to the cytoplasm during meiosis where it persists in spermatids and spermatozoa. Transposition and amplification of this autosomal gene during primate evolution gave rise to the DAZ gene cluster on the Y chromosome. Mutations in this gene have been linked to severe spermatogenic failure and infertility in males. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]
- Sycp3: This gene encodes an essential structural component of the synaptonemal complex. This complex is involved in synapsis, recombination and segregation of meiotic chromosomes. Mutations in this gene are associated with azoospermia in males and susceptibility to pregnancy loss in females. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, May 2010]
- Tex101: Predicted to be involved in binding activity of sperm to zona pellucida; flagellated sperm motility; and regulation of flagellated sperm motility. Predicted to be located in acrosomal vesicle; extracellular region; and plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in plasma membrane raft. Predicted to be anchored component of plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Tex12: This gene is similar to a mouse gene that is expressed in the testis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Smc1b: SMC1L2 belongs to a family of proteins required for chromatid cohesion and DNA recombination during meiosis and mitosis (3:Revenkova et al., 2001 [PubMed 11564881]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]
- Syce2: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the synaptonemal complex formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. The encoded protein associates with SYCP1 and SYCE1 and is found only where chromosome cores are synapsed. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2012]
- Fkbp6: The protein encoded by this gene is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that may function in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This gene is located in a chromosomal region that is deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome. Defects in this gene may cause male infertility. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene located nearby on chromosome 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
- Slc25a31: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ADP/ATP carrier family of proteins that exchange cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP in the mitochondria. Cells over-expressing this gene have been shown to display an anti-apoptotic phenotype. This protein is also thought to play a role in spermatogenesis, where it is believed to associate with a part of the flagellar cytoskeleton and with glycolytic enzymes. Male mice with mutations in the mouse ortholog of this gene are sterile and spermatocytes display an early meiotic arrest phenotype. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]
- Tex30: Predicted to enable hydrolase activity. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on these markers: Stra8, Dazl, Sycp3, Tex101, Tex12, Smc1b, Syce2, Fkbp6, Slc25a31, and Tex30.

First, I remember that many of these genes are involved in germ cell development and meiosis. Let me go through each one.

Stra8 is mentioned in the context of meiotic initiation in spermatogenesis and oogenesis in mice. So it's probably active in germ cells starting meiosis. Dazl is important in germ cells too, both male and female, involved in gametogenesis. Sycp3 is part of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis, so definitely involved in germ cells undergoing meiosis.

Tex101 and Tex12 are testis-expressed genes. Tex101 is involved in sperm-zona pellucida binding and motility. Tex12 in mice is testis-specific. Smc1b is part of the cohesion complex in meiosis. Syce2 is another synaptonemal complex protein, so again meiosis. Fkbp6 is linked to male infertility in mice. Slc25a31 is involved in spermatogenesis, and mutations cause meiotic arrest. Tex30 is another testis-related gene.

Putting this together, all these markers are associated with germ cells, specifically those undergoing meiosis. Since they are mostly testis-expressed and involved in spermatogenesis, the cell types are likely spermatogenic cells. The stages would be spermatogonia (early), spermatocytes (undergoing meiosis), and spermatids (post-meiotic). But which order?

Stra8 is involved in meiotic initiation, so maybe in spermatogonia transitioning to spermatocytes. Sycp3 and Syce2 are part of the synaptonemal complex in spermatocytes during meiosis. Dazl is present in spermatogonia and persists through meiosis. Tex101 and Tex12 are more in later stages like spermatids. Smc1b and Slc25a31 are involved in meiosis, so spermatocytes. Fkbp6 is in spermatocytes as well. Tex30 might be later stages.

So the top three would be cells involved in different stages of spermatogenesis. The primary spermatocytes (meiotic), spermatids (post-meiotic), and spermatogonia (pre-meiotic). But considering the markers, spermatocytes have multiple markers (Sycp3, Syce2, Smc1b, Fkbp6, Slc25a31). Spermatids have Tex101, Tex12, Tex30. Spermatogonia have Stra8 and Dazl. But since the markers are a mix, maybe the strongest association is with spermatocytes first, then spermatids, then spermatogonia. Alternatively, if the markers are for more specific types, maybe spermatocytes, spermatids, and maybe Sertoli cells? Wait, but Sertoli cells are support cells and don't express these germ cell markers. So definitely germ cells. So the top three cell types would be Spermatocytes, Spermatids, Spermatogonia. But I need to check if there's a more precise terminology. In some contexts, they may use terms like spermatogonial stem cells, primary spermatocytes, round spermatids. But the question asks for cell types, not stages. The general cell types in spermatogenesis are Spermatogonia, Spermatocytes, Spermatids. So based on the markers provided, since most are involved in meiosis (Spermatocytes) and post-meiotic (Spermatids), and some in early stages (Spermatogonia), the order would be Spermatocytes first, then Spermatids, then Spermatogonia. Alternatively, if some markers are specific to later stages, maybe Spermatids come first. But Sycp3 is in spermatocytes. Let me confirm:

Stra8: expressed in pre-meiotic germ cells (spermatogonia) initiating meiosis.

Dazl: present in spermatogonia and through meiosis.

Sycp3: expressed in spermatocytes during meiosis.

Tex101: spermatids.

Tex12: spermatocytes? Maybe.

Smc1b: meiosis, so spermatocytes.

Syce2: spermatocytes.

Fkbp6: spermatocytes.

Slc25a31: spermatocytes (meiotic arrest if defective).

Tex30: maybe spermatids.

So the majority of the markers (Sycp3, Syce2, Smc1b, Fkbp6, Slc25a31, Tex12) are in spermatocytes. Then Tex101, Tex30 in spermatids. Stra8 and Dazl in spermatogonia. So the most markers are in spermatocytes, so that's first. Then spermatids with a couple, then spermatogonia. So the top 3 cell types are Spermatocytes, Spermatids, Spermatogonia. Are there other possible cell types? For example, oocytes? But the markers like Tex101, Tex12 are testis-specific. So probably male germ cells. So yes, the answer is Spermatocytes, Spermatids, Spermatogonia, ordered by the number of markers each has.
