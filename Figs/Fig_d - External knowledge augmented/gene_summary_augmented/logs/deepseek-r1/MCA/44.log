Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Ccl5: This gene is one of several chemokine genes clustered on the q-arm of chromosome 17. Chemokines form a superfamily of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The superfamily is divided into four subfamilies based on the arrangement of the N-terminal cysteine residues of the mature peptide. This chemokine, a member of the CC subfamily, functions as a chemoattractant for blood monocytes, memory T helper cells and eosinophils. It causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. This cytokine is one of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ cells. It functions as one of the natural ligands for the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), and it suppresses in vitro replication of the R5 strains of HIV-1, which use CCR5 as a coreceptor. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
- Nkg7: Predicted to be integral component of plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- AW112010: Gene ID not found
- Klrd1: Natural killer (NK) cells are a distinct lineage of lymphocytes that mediate cytotoxic activity and secrete cytokines upon immune stimulation. Several genes of the C-type lectin superfamily, including members of the NKG2 family, are expressed by NK cells and may be involved in the regulation of NK cell function. KLRD1 (CD94) is an antigen preferentially expressed on NK cells and is classified as a type II membrane protein because it has an external C terminus. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2017]
- Gzma: Cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells share the remarkable ability to recognize, bind, and lyse specific target cells. They are thought to protect their host by lysing cells bearing on their surface 'nonself' antigens, usually peptides or proteins resulting from infection by intracellular pathogens. The protein described here is a T cell- and natural killer cell-specific serine protease that may function as a common component necessary for lysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ms4a4b: DISCONTINUED: The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is no longer reporting records created for non-human orthologs.
- Il2rb: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin 2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. The use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. The protein is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system. The use by some variants of an alternate promoter in an upstream long terminal repeat (LTR) results in placenta-specific expression.

- Klre1: DISCONTINUED: The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is no longer reporting records created for non-human orthologs.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Ccl5, Nkg7, AW112010, Klrd1, Gzma, Ms4a4b, Il2rb, Klrb1c, Klre1, and Klra4. 

First, I need to recall what each of these genes typically marks in terms of cell types. Let's go through each gene one by one using the provided summaries.

Starting with Ccl5: The summary says it's a chemokine involved in attracting monocytes, memory T helper cells, and eosinophils. It's also a ligand for CCR5 and is produced by CD8+ T cells. So, Ccl5 is associated with T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, and maybe NK cells since they also produce chemokines.

Nkg7: The summary mentions it's predicted to be part of the plasma membrane. I'm not super familiar with this gene, but a quick recall from immunology: NKG7 is often expressed in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells (like CD8+ T cells). It's involved in the cytolytic activity.

AW112010: The Gene ID isn't found, so perhaps it's a non-standard or outdated identifier. I might need to skip this one unless I can find another reference, but based on the given data, not much info here.

Klrd1: This is CD94, part of the NKG2 family expressed on NK cells. The summary specifically states it's on NK cells and involved in their regulation. So Klrd1 is a strong marker for NK cells.

Gzma: Granzyme A. This is a serine protease found in cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and NK cells. It's involved in inducing apoptosis in target cells. So Gzma is a marker for both NK cells and CD8+ T cells.

Ms4a4b: The note says it's discontinued as HGNC isn't reporting non-human orthologs. However, I recall that in mice, Ms4a4b is sometimes associated with T cells, particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) or certain subsets. Alternatively, some MS4A family members are in B cells (like CD20, MS4A1), but Ms4a4b might be in T cells. But not certain. Need to verify.

Il2rb: Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain. IL2RB is part of the IL-2 receptor complex. It's expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells. However, high expression is often in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and memory T cells, as well as NK cells. So this could point to activated T cells or NK cells.

Klrb1c: Gene ID not found. Klrb1 is the killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily B member 1. In mice, Klrb1c might be a variant, but without the gene info, hard to say. Klrb1 family members are often on NK cells and some T cell subsets.

Klre1: Discontinued, but Klre1 in mice is part of the NK cell receptor complex, possibly involved in NK cell activation. So again, pointing to NK cells.

Klra4: Gene ID not found. Klra refers to Ly49 receptors in mice, which are NK cell receptors. Ly49 genes are part of the NK cell recognition system. So Klra4 would be an NK cell marker.

Now, compiling this: The markers that are clearly associated with NK cells are Klrd1 (CD94), Gzma (also in CTLs), Klre1 (if valid), Klra4 (Ly49 family), and possibly Nkg7. Ccl5 is in CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Il2rb is in activated T cells and NK cells. Ms4a4b might be Tregs or another T subset. Klrb1c (if similar to Klrb1) is NK or T cells.

So the strongest indicators here are Klrd1 (NK), Klra4 (NK), Klre1 (NK), Gzma (NK and CD8+ T), Nkg7 (NK and CD8+ T), Ccl5 (CD8+ T and NK). Il2rb is in T and NK. So if multiple markers point to NK cells, that's a top candidate. CD8+ T cells would also be a possibility, as they share some markers like Gzma, Ccl5, Nkg7. However, NK-specific markers like Klrd1, Klra4, Klre1 would tilt towards NK cells. 

So the top three cell types would likely be:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells: Because of Klrd1, Klra4 (assuming it's Ly49), Klre1, Gzma, Nkg7, and possibly Il2rb.

2. CD8+ T Cells: They express Ccl5, Gzma, Nkg7, and Il2rb. But fewer NK-specific markers here.

3. Maybe Gamma Delta T cells or another T cell subset? Alternatively, if there's a T cell subset that shares some NK markers, like NKT cells. But NKT cells are a subset that co-express T cell markers and some NK receptors. However, given the markers here, perhaps activated CD8+ T cells would be next. Alternatively, if Ms4a4b is for Tregs, but that's less certain.

Wait, Ms4a4b in mice: Some sources indicate that Ms4a4b is expressed in T cells, particularly in activated CD8+ T cells and some Th subsets. So combining that with Il2rb (activated T cells), maybe CD8+ T cells are the second. Then third could be Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), which are CD8+ T cells, so maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe another type like NKT cells, but without more specific markers, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe Gamma Delta T cells, but not sure.

Alternatively, considering that NK cells are the top, followed by CD8+ T cells, and then maybe a subset like memory T cells or regulatory T cells. But with the markers given, perhaps the third is a T cell type. Alternatively, given that some markers are not found or discontinued, maybe the third is a less certain cell type. Alternatively, maybe the third is a dendritic cell subset, but I don't think so. Ccl5 is also in some dendritic cells, but more prominent in T cells and NK.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of innate lymphoid cell (ILC), but I think NK cells are the primary ILC1. So perhaps the top three are NK cells, CD8+ T cells, and maybe NKT cells.

But in the absence of more specific markers, the most probable top three based on the strongest markers (Klrd1, Klra4, Gzma, Nkg7) would be:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells

2. CD8+ Cytotoxic T Cells

3. Maybe Gamma Delta T Cells or NKT Cells. But if the markers for T cells are strong enough, but given that Klrd1 is more NK-specific, maybe the third is a T cell subset. Alternatively, considering that Il2rb is part of the IL-2 receptor expressed on activated T cells, Tregs, and NK cells, but Tregs have other markers like Foxp3, which isn't listed here. So maybe activated CD8+ T cells would be second, and then another T cell type.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a memory T cell subset. But I need to think about which markers are more specific.

Another angle: Let's count the number of markers pointing to each cell type.

NK cell markers: Klrd1, Klra4 (assuming), Klre1 (if valid), Gzma (shared), Nkg7 (shared), Klrb1c (if similar to NK receptors), Il2rb (shared). So several specific markers here.

CD8+ T cells: Ccl5, Gzma, Nkg7, Il2rb, Ms4a4b (maybe). So shared markers, but fewer unique to CD8+ T.

So NK cells have more unique markers. Then CD8+ T. Third could be a T cell subset, but perhaps NKT cells which have both T and NK markers. However, NKT cells are a subset of T cells that express NK markers. But with the markers here, if there are both T and NK markers, maybe NKT is possible. But I think in this case, the primary would be NK cells, then CD8+ T, then maybe Gamma Delta T cells or another type.

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a type of dendritic cell or macrophage, but Ccl5 is also in monocytes, but the other markers don't support that.

Alternatively, considering AW112010 is unknown, and Ms4a4b might not be helpful. So, given the markers, the top three are likely:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells

2. CD8+ Cytotoxic T Cells

3. Gamma Delta T Cells (if Gzma and other markers are present) or maybe activated T cells.

But Gamma Delta T cells do express some NK markers, but I'm not sure if the markers here are specific enough. Alternatively, maybe Memory CD8+ T Cells.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of innate lymphoid cell, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the third is T cells in general, but since we already have CD8+ T cells, perhaps another subset.

Alternatively, given that Il2rb is part of the IL-2 receptor beta chain, which is also present in regulatory T cells (Tregs), but Tregs are usually CD4+ and express Foxp3, which isn't listed here. So maybe Tregs are less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a monocyte/macrophage, but Ccl5 is involved in attracting monocytes, but other markers don't support that.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of B cell, but Ms4a4b is discontinued and others don't point to B cells.

Given all this, I think the most logical top three would be:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells

2. CD8+ T Cells

3. Gamma Delta T Cells or NKT Cells

But between these, which is more supported? NKT cells are T cells that express NK markers. They have a T cell receptor (TCR) but also express markers like CD161 (in humans) or NK1.1 in mice. However, Klrb1c (if similar to Klrb1) might be NK1.1, which is a marker for NKT cells. But since Klrb1c's gene ID isn't found, it's uncertain. Similarly, Klra4 being Ly49 might be more NK-specific.

Alternatively, if the majority of markers are NK-related, then maybe the third is another NK subset, but typically, NK cells are considered a single type with subsets. Alternatively, the third could be a T cell subset like effector memory CD8+ T cells.

Alternatively, the presence of Ccl5, which is also in CD8+ T cells, and Il2rb (activated T cells), so maybe activated CD8+ T cells as the second, and then maybe another T cell type. But without more markers, it's hard.

Given the information, the safest answer would be:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells

2. CD8+ T Cells

3. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) – but CTLs are CD8+ T cells, so that's redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of innate lymphoid cell (ILC), but I think ILC1 are NK cells. ILC2 and ILC3 have different markers.

Alternatively, based on the presence of Il2rb, which is in Tregs, but again, lacking Foxp3.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a memory T cell.

But considering the markers provided, the strongest are pointing to NK and CD8+ T cells. The third may be a stretch, but perhaps Gamma Delta T cells. Alternatively, if the user expects three distinct types, maybe NK, CD8+ T, and NKT. However, without explicit markers for NKT (like CD3 and NK markers), it's hard. But since some markers here are NK and T cell related, maybe NKT is possible.

Alternatively, the third could be a dendritic cell subset, but again, not enough markers.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a macrophage, but again, not enough markers.

Alternatively, considering that Ms4a4b is discontinued, but in some references, Ms4a4b in mice is expressed in T cells, especially exhausted CD8+ T cells in chronic infections. So if that's the case, maybe exhausted CD8+ T cells, but that's a subset.

Alternatively, the third could be regulatory T cells if Il2rb and Ms4a4b are involved, but I don't think so.

Given all this, the top three most likely are:

1. Natural Killer (NK) Cells

2. CD8+ T Cells

3. NKT Cells

But if the markers don't sufficiently support NKT, maybe Gamma Delta T Cells. Alternatively, if the user wants three distinct types, maybe NK, CD8+ T, and then another T cell subset. But since the question is about mouse cells, and the markers given, the third might be a stretch. Alternatively, given that some markers are not found or discontinued, perhaps the third is a T cell type.

But given the information, I'll go with:

Natural Killer (NK) Cells, CD8+ T Cells, and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (which are CD8+ T cells). But that's redundant. So maybe the third is Gamma Delta T Cells.

Alternatively, another approach: looking up each gene in cell marker databases.

But since I can't access external databases, I have to rely on the given summaries and my knowledge.

So, to sum up, the markers Klrd1 (CD94), Klra4 (Ly49), and Klre1 are strong NK markers. Gzma and Nkg7 are in both NK and CD8+ T. Ccl5 is in CD8+ T and NK. Il2rb is in activated T and NK. Ms4a4b may be in T cells. So NK is first, CD8+ T is second. For third, maybe activated CD8+ T cells, or another T subset. But perhaps the third is NKT cells, as they have both T and NK markers. However, without a T cell receptor marker (like CD3), it's hard to confirm. But given the presence of both T and NK markers, NKT is a possibility.

So the final answer would be:

Natural Killer (NK) Cells, CD8+ T Cells, NKT Cells

Alternatively, if NKT is not considered a top possibility, the third could be Gamma Delta T Cells. But I think NKT is more likely here.
