Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Hspa1b: This intronless gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family. In conjuction with other heat shock proteins, this protein stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and in organelles. It is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through interaction with the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1. The gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, in a cluster with two closely related genes which encode similar proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Clec4g: This gene encodes a glycan-binding receptor and member of the C-type lectin family which plays a role in the immune response. C-type lectin receptors are pattern recognition receptors located on immune cells that play a role in the recognition and uptake of both self and non-self glycoproteins as well as mediating cell adhesion, glycoprotein clearance, and cell signaling functions. This gene's protein binds complex-type N-glycans of the viral envelope proteins of Ebola virus, West Nile filovirus, and SARS coronavirus, but not HIV or hepatitis C virus. In mouse, this protein has been shown to recognize activated T-cells and to negatively regulate T-cell receptor-mediated signalling. It also acts as a novel, liver-specific regulator of NK cell-mediated immunity in mouse. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2020]
- Cxcl10: This antimicrobial gene encodes a chemokine of the CXC subfamily and ligand for the receptor CXCR3. Binding of this protein to CXCR3 results in pleiotropic effects, including stimulation of monocytes, natural killer and T-cell migration, and modulation of adhesion molecule expression. This gene may also be a key regulator of the 'cytokine storm' immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2020]
- Selenop: This gene encodes a selenoprotein that is predominantly expressed in the liver and secreted into the plasma. This selenoprotein is unique in that it contains multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues per polypeptide (10 in human), and accounts for most of the selenium in plasma. It has been implicated as an extracellular antioxidant, and in the transport of selenium to extra-hepatic tissues via apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2). Mice lacking this gene exhibit neurological dysfunction, suggesting its importance in normal brain function. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. The mRNA for this selenoprotein contains two SECIS elements. The use of alternative polyadenylation sites, one located in between the two SECIS elements, results in two populations of mRNAs containing either both (predominant) or just the upstream SECIS element (PMID:27881738). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have also been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2018]
- Fcgr2b: The protein encoded by this gene is a low affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin gamma complexes. The encoded protein is involved in the phagocytosis of immune complexes and in the regulation of antibody production by B-cells. Variations in this gene may increase susceptibilty to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]
- Aqp1: This gene encodes a small integral membrane protein with six bilayer spanning domains that functions as a water channel protein. This protein permits passive transport of water along an osmotic gradient. This gene is a possible candidate for disorders involving imbalance in ocular fluid movement. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]
- Hspa1a: This intronless gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family. In conjuction with other heat shock proteins, this protein stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and in organelles. It is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through interaction with the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1. The gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, in a cluster with two closely related genes which encode similar proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Eng: This gene encodes a homodimeric transmembrane protein which is a major glycoprotein of the vascular endothelium. This protein is a component of the transforming growth factor beta receptor complex and it binds to the beta1 and beta3 peptides with high affinity. Mutations in this gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome 1, an autosomal dominant multisystemic vascular dysplasia. This gene may also be involved in preeclampsia and several types of cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]
- Il1a: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine family. This cytokine is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in various immune responses, inflammatory processes, and hematopoiesis. This cytokine is produced by monocytes and macrophages as a proprotein, which is proteolytically processed and released in response to cell injury, and thus induces apoptosis. This gene and eight other interleukin 1 family genes form a cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 2. It has been suggested that the polymorphism of these genes is associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Dnase1l3: This gene encodes a member of the deoxyribonuclease I family. The encoded protein hydrolyzes DNA, is not inhibited by actin, and mediates the breakdown of DNA during apoptosis. Mutations in this gene are a cause of systemic lupus erythematosus-16. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

===================deepseek-r1 response =====================
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Hspa1b, Clec4g, Cxcl10, Selenop, Fcgr2b, Aqp1, Hspa1a, Eng, Il1a, Dnase1l3.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall which cell types they're associated with. 

Starting with Hspa1b and Hspa1a. These are heat shock proteins, which are often involved in stress responses. They might be expressed in various cells under stress, but maybe more specifically in certain immune cells or epithelial cells. But they might not be cell-specific markers on their own.

Clec4g is a C-type lectin receptor. From the description, it's involved in immune responses, recognizes viral proteins, and in mice, it's liver-specific and regulates NK cells. So maybe liver endothelial cells or Kupffer cells? Or NK cells? Wait, the summary says it's a liver-specific regulator of NK cell-mediated immunity. So maybe liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) express Clec4g. LSECs are known to have various immune functions.

Cxcl10 is a chemokine ligand for CXCR3. It's involved in attracting T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. Cells that secrete Cxcl10 are often activated in response to IFN-gamma, like macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, or fibroblasts during inflammation. So maybe macrophages or dendritic cells?

Selenop is a selenium transport protein, highly expressed in the liver. So liver cells, maybe hepatocytes? Since it's secreted into plasma, hepatocytes produce a lot of plasma proteins. But also, the description mentions that mice lacking this gene have neurological issues, but the main expression is liver.

Fcgr2b is an Fc gamma receptor, low affinity. Expressed on B cells and myeloid cells like macrophages, dendritic cells. It's involved in phagocytosis and regulating B cell activation. So presence here might indicate B cells or macrophages.

Aqp1 is aquaporin 1, a water channel. Found in cells involved in water transport, like kidney proximal tubules, erythrocytes, endothelial cells. Maybe endothelial cells or red blood cells? But RBCs in mice are nucleated, but I think Aqp1 is in various endothelial cells.

Eng is endoglin, a marker for endothelial cells. It's part of the TGF-beta receptor complex. Definitely endothelial cells here. High expression in endothelial cells.

Il1a is interleukin 1 alpha, produced by monocytes, macrophages, epithelial cells. So presence here might indicate macrophages or other immune cells.

Dnase1l3 is a DNase involved in apoptosis, mutations linked to lupus. Expressed in cells that clear apoptotic debris, maybe macrophages or certain epithelial cells. Or in the liver, since DNase1l3 is also involved in serum DNA degradation.

Putting this all together:

Eng is a strong marker for endothelial cells. Clec4g is mentioned to be liver-specific in mice and involved with NK cells, so maybe liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) which are a type of endothelial cell but have immune functions. Aqp1 is also in endothelial cells. So endothelial cells might be one of the top.

Selenop is highly liver-specific, so hepatocytes. But hepatocytes are parenchymal liver cells. But if Eng is endothelial, then maybe the cell type is a mix? Wait, but each cell type has multiple markers. Let's check which markers go together.

If the markers include Eng (endothelial), Aqp1 (endothelial), Clec4g (liver endothelial), then maybe liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Then Selenop would be hepatocytes, but that's a different cell type. But how do the markers combine?

Wait, let's see. The markers provided are all from the same cell? The question is about a single cell's markers, so the cell would express all of these. But that might not make sense unless it's a cell type that has a combination of these. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture of markers from different cell types, but the task is to find the most likely cell type based on the combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the markers are a mix from different cell types, but the user is asking for the top 3 cell types that these markers are most associated with, not necessarily all present in one cell. Wait, the question says "using the following markers" so the cell has all these markers. But some of these markers are specific to different cell types. So maybe it's a cell that has a combination of endothelial markers (Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g (liver endothelial)), plus some immune markers (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a), and others.

Wait, but liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) do express Clec4g (as per the gene summary), Eng (endothelial), Aqp1 (maybe), and maybe some immune-related genes like Fcgr2b and Cxcl10. LSECs are known to have immune functions, antigen presentation, and produce chemokines. They also have scavenger functions. Selenop is mainly hepatocyte, but if the cell has Selenop, maybe it's a hepatocyte, but hepatocytes don't typically express endothelial markers. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell type is a macrophage. Macrophages can express Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Clec4g (if in liver), Hspa1a/b (stress response). But Eng is endothelial. Unless it's a Kupffer cell (liver macrophage), but do they express Eng? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cell is a dendritic cell. Dendritic cells might express Clec4g, Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a. But Eng is endothelial. So maybe not.

Wait, Eng is endoglin, which is primarily endothelial. So if a cell has Eng, it's likely an endothelial cell. Then, other markers like Clec4g (LSEC), Aqp1 (endothelial), Cxcl10 (activated endothelial cells during inflammation), Fcgr2b (expressed on B cells and myeloid cells, but endothelial cells may have some Fc receptors?), Hspa1a/b (stress response in endothelial cells). Selenop is the odd one out here, as it's mainly in hepatocytes. But maybe LSECs produce Selenop? Not that I know of. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a liver endothelial cell that also has some hepatocyte markers? Unlikely.

Alternatively, the presence of Selenop might indicate a hepatocyte, but then Eng and Clec4g would not fit. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) which expresses Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1, and maybe other markers. Then, Fcgr2b could be present in LSECs. Cxcl10 is produced by endothelial cells when activated. Il1a could be from activated endothelial cells. Dnase1l3 is involved in DNA degradation, maybe in cells that process apoptotic bodies, which LSECs do as part of their scavenger function. Hspa1a/b are stress proteins, which could be expressed under certain conditions. Selenop is the only one that's confusing here. Unless there's a cell type that co-expresses Selenop with endothelial markers. Maybe not. So perhaps Selenop is a red herring, or maybe it's a marker for a different cell type in this context.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a macrophage in the liver. Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) express Clec4g? Maybe. They do express Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a. But Eng would not be expressed in macrophages. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a plasmacytoid dendritic cell, but again, Eng is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the markers come from a mixture of cell types, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types that these markers are most associated with, regardless of co-expression. For example:

- Endothelial cells (due to Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g in LSECs)
- Hepatocytes (Selenop)
- Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a)

But the user wants the top 3 cell types for the given markers, assuming they are all expressed in one cell. That complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the markers are from a liver cell type that has both endothelial and hepatocyte markers, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a hepatic stellate cell, but I'm not sure about their markers.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC), which expresses Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1, and perhaps under stress expresses Hspa1a/b. They might also produce Cxcl10 when activated. Fcgr2b could be present. Selenop is the outlier here. Maybe Selenop is a contaminant or a less specific marker. But according to the gene summary, Selenop is mainly in the liver and secreted into plasma. If the cell is a hepatocyte, it would have Selenop but not the endothelial markers. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell is a type of endothelial cell that also secretes Selenop. But I don't think endothelial cells produce Selenop. That's more hepatocytes.

Alternatively, maybe the top cell type is Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells (due to Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1), then Hepatocytes (Selenop), then Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a). But the problem is that the task requires the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided, assuming they are all expressed in the same cell. But if that's impossible, perhaps the markers are a mix, and the answer is the three cell types most represented by the markers.

Alternatively, perhaps the markers point to different cell types, but the strongest ones are:

1. Endothelial cells (Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g)
2. Hepatocytes (Selenop)
3. Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Dnase1l3)

But the user wants the top 3 cell types for a cell that has all these markers. That's tricky. Maybe the cell is a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell that is activated, hence expressing Cxcl10, Il1a, Hspa1a/b, and maybe some Fcgr2b. Dnase1l3 could be involved in processing DNA from apoptotic cells they engulf. Selenop is the only one that doesn't fit. Unless there's a specific subtype that expresses Selenop, but I don't recall that.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a Kupffer cell (liver macrophage) that has taken up Selenop from hepatocytes, but that's a stretch. Usually, markers are about genes expressed by the cell itself, not uptake.

Alternatively, perhaps Selenop is a misdirection, or the cell is a hepatocyte with some contamination of endothelial markers. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

1. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1)
2. Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a)
3. Hepatocytes (Selenop)

But the user wants the top 3 cell types for a single cell expressing all markers, which might not exist. Alternatively, the markers are indicative of a mix, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types that have the most markers from the list.

So, counting markers:

Endothelial markers: Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g (maybe), Cxcl10 (if activated), Hspa1a/b (stress)

Macrophage markers: Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Dnase1l3 (maybe)

Hepatocyte: Selenop

So, if the cell has Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g, which are strong for endothelial, then endothelial is top. Then, Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a point to macrophages as second. Selenop points to hepatocytes as third.

Alternatively, since Clec4g is specific to liver endothelial, the top would be Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells. Then, markers like Fcgr2b and others might be present in LSECs as part of their immune functions. For example, LSECs do express some Fc receptors and can produce chemokines like Cxcl10. They also might express Hspa1a/b under stress. Il1a could be expressed in activated endothelial cells. Dnase1l3 might be involved in their scavenger function. Selenop is the only one not fitting. But maybe the cell is a hepatocyte with some contamination, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps Selenop is a misleading marker here, or there's an error. But according to the data given, Selenop is in the list.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, and Selenop is a less specific marker, or there's an overlap. But I don't think hepatocytes and endothelial cells share Selenop expression. So Selenop would point to hepatocytes, but how does that fit with the other markers?

This is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to prioritize the markers that are most cell-type specific.

Eng is very specific to endothelial cells. Clec4g is specific to liver endothelial cells. Aqp1 is in endothelial. So combining these, the cell is likely a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell. Then, other markers like Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Hspa1a/b could be explained by activation or stress. Dnase1l3 might be part of their function in clearing DNA. Selenop is the odd one out. Maybe the cell is a hepatocyte, but then Eng and Clec4g wouldn't be there. Alternatively, maybe Selenop is expressed in another cell type. Wait, the Selenop summary says it's predominantly in liver and secreted into plasma. So maybe the cell is a hepatocyte, but then the endothelial markers don't fit. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is three different cell types, but the question implies that the markers are from one cell type. Therefore, the most probable cell type that expresses most of these markers is liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, even if Selenop is an outlier. Then, maybe the next likely cell types are macrophages and hepatocytes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the markers are from a dendritic cell subtype. Let's see: Clec4g is a C-type lectin, which some dendritic cells express. Fcgr2b is on dendritic cells. Cxcl10 is produced by dendritic cells. But Eng is not typical for dendritic cells.

Alternatively, the cell could be a liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) which expresses Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1, and under certain conditions expresses Cxcl10, Il1a. Fcgr2b might be present. Hspa1a/b are stress proteins. Dnase1l3 could be involved in their scavenger role. Selenop remains a problem. Unless LSECs also express Selenop, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a hepatic stellate cell, but their markers are different (e.g., desmin, GFAP).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake and Selenop is not a key marker here. If we ignore Selenop, then the cell is likely LSEC. But since Selenop is in the list, maybe the user expects hepatocytes as one of the answers. But how to reconcile?

Alternatively, the top three cell types could be:

1. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (due to Clec4g, Eng, Aqp1)
2. Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a)
3. Hepatocytes (Selenop)

But the user wants the top 3 cell types for the same cell. If that's not possible, maybe the answer is three different cell types ranked by the number of markers they have. So endothelial cells have Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g, maybe Cxcl10, Hspa1a/b. That's 5 markers. Macrophages have Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Dnase1l3. That's 4. Hepatocytes have Selenop. So the ranking would be endothelial cells, macrophages, hepatocytes.

Therefore, the top 3 would be:

1. Endothelial cells
2. Macrophages
3. Hepatocytes

But I need to confirm if these markers fit.

Endothelial cells: Eng (definite), Aqp1 (yes), Clec4g (LSEC), Cxcl10 (activated), Hspa1a/b (stress). So that's 5 markers.

Macrophages: Fcgr2b (yes), Cxcl10 (yes, when activated), Il1a (yes), Dnase1l3 (possible). So 4 markers.

Hepatocytes: Selenop (definite). Only 1 marker.

So ranking by number of markers, the top 3 would be Endothelial cells, Macrophages, Hepatocytes.

But maybe the specific type of endothelial cells is Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (due to Clec4g), so perhaps specifying that.

Alternatively, the answer might list Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells as the first, Macrophages second, Hepatocytes third.

Alternatively, considering that Clec4g is a specific marker for LSECs, which are a subtype of endothelial cells, the first cell type is LSEC.

But the user asks for cell type names. So perhaps:

1. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
2. Macrophages
3. Hepatocytes

But I need to make sure. Let me check each marker again:

- Clec4g: mouse, liver-specific, regulates NK cells. So LSEC.
- Eng: endothelial cells.
- Aqp1: endothelial and other cells.
- Fcgr2b: B cells and myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells).
- Cxcl10: produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells when activated.
- Il1a: macrophages, epithelial cells.
- Dnase1l3: macrophages, maybe?
- Hspa1a/b: stress inducible, various cells.
- Selenop: hepatocytes.

So combining, the cell has markers of endothelial (Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g), macrophage (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Dnase1l3), and hepatocyte (Selenop). But since a single cell can't be all three, the most likely is that the markers are a mix, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types these markers correspond to, regardless of co-expression. So the answer would be the three cell types with the most markers.

Thus:

1. Endothelial cells (Eng, Aqp1, Clec4g)
2. Macrophages (Fcgr2b, Cxcl10, Il1a, Dnase1l3)
3. Hepatocytes (Selenop)

Hspa1a/b are stress genes and not cell-specific.

Therefore, the top 3 cell types are Endothelial cells, Macrophages, Hepatocytes.
