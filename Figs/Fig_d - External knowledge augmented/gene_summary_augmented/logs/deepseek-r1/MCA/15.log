Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Wap: Gene ID not found
- Csn1s2b: This locus is found in a cluster of casein genes, similar to other mammals. In human, the potential open reading frame that matches the homologous protein from other species is prematurely truncated shortly after the signal peptide. Therefore, this locus appears to be a pseudogene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010]
- Csn1s2a: This locus is the equivalent of casein gamma in mouse (GeneID 12993) and is found in a cluster of casein genes, similar to other mammals. In human, the potential open reading frame that matches the homologous protein from other species is prematurely truncated shortly after the signal peptide. Therefore, this locus appears to be a pseudogene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Csn1s1: Predicted to be involved in response to dehydroepiandrosterone; response to estradiol; and response to steroid hormone. Located in extracellular space. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Csn2: Predicted to enable transcription corepressor activity. Involved in protein deneddylation and protein phosphorylation. Located in cytoplasm. Part of COP9 signalosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Csn3: The protein encoded by this gene possesses kinase activity that phosphorylates regulators involved in signal transduction. It phosphorylates I kappa-Balpha, p105, and c-Jun. It acts as a docking site for complex-mediated phosphorylation. The gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]
- Glycam1: Predicted to enable cell adhesion molecule binding activity and sulfate binding activity. Predicted to act upstream of or within response to bacterium. Predicted to be located in extracellular region. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Lalba: This gene encodes alpha-lactalbumin, a principal protein of milk. Alpha-lactalbumin forms the regulatory subunit of the lactose synthase (LS) heterodimer and beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) forms the catalytic component. Together, these proteins enable LS to produce lactose by transfering galactose moieties to glucose. As a monomer, alpha-lactalbumin strongly binds calcium and zinc ions and may possess bactericidal or antitumor activity. A folding variant of alpha-lactalbumin, called HAMLET, likely induces apoptosis in tumor and immature cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Wfdc18: Gene ID not found
- Lao1: Gene ID not found


Here are the marker genes, please finish the task: Wap, Csn1s2b, Csn1s2a, Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn3, Glycam1, Lalba, Wfdc18, Lao1

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Wap, Csn1s2b, Csn1s2a, Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn3, Glycam1, Lalba, Wfdc18, and Lao1.

First, I need to recall what each of these genes does, especially in the context of mouse cell types. Let's go through each gene one by one using the provided summaries:

- **Wap**: Gene ID not found. Hmm, but I know that WAP stands for Whey Acidic Protein, which is associated with mammary glands and lactation in some species. Even though the Gene ID isn't found here, maybe it's a marker for mammary epithelial cells.
  
- **Csn1s2b** and **Csn1s2a**: Both are part of the casein gene cluster. The summaries mention they are pseudogenes in humans, but in mice, Csn1s2a is equivalent to casein gamma. Caseins are major milk proteins, so these are likely markers for mammary epithelial cells or cells involved in milk production.

- **Csn1s1**: Involved in response to hormones like estradiol and DHEA. Also located in extracellular space. This sounds like another casein gene, so again, mammary cells.

- **Csn2**: Has transcription corepressor activity and involved in protein phosphorylation. The name Csn2 might be part of the casein family (like beta-casein), but the description here mentions the COP9 signalosome, which is a complex involved in protein degradation. Wait, but casein genes in mice are usually Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn3, etc. Maybe Csn2 here is beta-casein. If so, that's another milk protein, so mammary epithelial cells again.

- **Csn3**: The summary here talks about kinase activity, phosphorylating proteins like IκBα and c-Jun. However, in mice, Csn3 is also kappa-casein, another milk protein. The description here might be conflating with another gene, but given the context of other casein genes, it's likely part of the casein cluster. So mammary cells again.

- **Glycam1**: Predicted to be involved in cell adhesion and response to bacteria. GlyCAM-1 is Glycosylation-Dependent Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, which I think is expressed in high endothelial venules, but also in mammary glands. Alternatively, maybe in secretory cells.

- **Lalba**: Alpha-lactalbumin, a principal milk protein. This is a key component of lactose synthase, so definitely mammary epithelial cells involved in milk production.

The other genes (Wfdc18 and Lao1) have no Gene ID found, so maybe they are less critical here.

Putting this all together, the majority of these markers are caseins (Csn genes) and Lalba, which are all involved in milk production. Therefore, the cell type is most likely mammary epithelial cells, specifically those involved in lactation. Since the user is asking for mouse cells, and these are all markers associated with milk-producing cells, the top cell type would be mammary epithelial cells. But wait, the question asks for the top 3 cell types. However, all these markers point towards mammary gland cells. Are there other possibilities?

Wait, Glycam1 might be expressed in other secretory cells or endothelial cells. But given that the majority are caseins and lactalbumin, the primary cell type should be mammary epithelial cells. Let me think if there's a possibility of other cell types. For example, caseins are specific to mammary glands. Lalba is also mammary-specific. Wap, even though not found here, is a known marker for mammary cells. So maybe the top three cell types are all subtypes within the mammary gland? For example, alveolar cells, luminal epithelial cells, or myoepithelial cells. Alternatively, maybe during different stages of mammary gland development.

Alternatively, could there be other cell types that express some of these genes? Let me think. For instance, Csn3 here was described with kinase activity, but if that's a different Csn3 (not casein), but in mice, Csn3 is kappa-casein. So I think the answer here is that all these markers are specific to mammary epithelial cells, particularly those involved in milk synthesis. Therefore, the top three cell types would all be related to mammary gland, but perhaps different subpopulations. However, the user might expect the three most likely cell types, even if they are all mammary. Alternatively, maybe the markers also include some from other cell types.

Wait, Glycam1 is also found in lymph nodes, but in the context of these other markers, it's more likely part of mammary gland. Another possibility: some of these genes might be expressed in salivary glands, but caseins are more specific to mammary. So I think the answer is that the top 3 cell types are all mammary epithelial cells. But perhaps the user expects different names, like mammary gland alveolar cell, mammary gland luminal cell, and mammary gland secretory cell. Alternatively, maybe the top three are all the same, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects other cell types. Let me check the markers again. Wait, Csn2 here is described as part of the COP9 signalosome, which is involved in protein degradation. But in mice, Csn2 is beta-casein. Is there a possibility that this Csn2 is not the casein but another gene? The description here says "part of COP9 signalosome," which is a complex unrelated to caseins. Wait, this is conflicting. So there's a confusion here between casein genes and COP9 signalosome subunits. Because in mice, the casein genes are Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn3, etc., but the Gene summary here for Csn2 says it's part of COP9 signalosome. That's contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the gene symbols? Or maybe there's a nomenclature overlap. For example, in humans, CSN2 is a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, but in mice, Csn2 is beta-casein. So depending on the species, the same symbol can refer to different genes. But the user specified mouse cells, so Csn2 here is beta-casein. But the provided summary says it's part of COP9 signalosome. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user's data is incorrect? Or perhaps the gene symbols are being confused. For example, in mouse, the casein beta is Csn2, but the COP9 signalosome subunit might have a different symbol. This is a problem.

So, if the Csn2 here is part of the COP9 signalosome, then it's not related to casein. But that would contradict the other Csn genes (Csn1s1, etc.) which are caseins. So this is confusing. Let me check quickly. In mice, the casein genes are Csn1s1 (alpha s1 casein), Csn2 (beta casein), Csn3 (kappa casein). The COP9 signalosome subunits are named CSN1, CSN2, etc., but in human, they are CSN1, CSN2, etc. So in mouse, the COP9 subunits might have different symbols. For example, the COP9 signalosome subunit 2 in human is CSN2, but in mouse, it might be a different gene symbol. Therefore, in this context, if the user is referring to mouse Csn2, it's likely beta-casein. However, the provided summary for Csn2 here says it's part of the COP9 signalosome. That's conflicting. Therefore, there's an error in the provided data. But given that other Csn genes (Csn1s1, Csn1s2a, etc.) are caseins, it's more likely that the user intended these to be caseins, even if the summaries are conflicting. Maybe the summaries are from human genes, but the task is about mouse. So perhaps the descriptions are for human genes, but the user is asking about mouse, so the actual function in mouse is different. For example, in human, some casein genes are pseudogenes, but in mouse, they are functional. Therefore, despite the summaries mentioning pseudogenes in human, in mouse, these Csn genes are functional and part of casein production.

So, putting aside the confusion with Csn2's summary (assuming that in mouse, Csn2 is beta-casein), the markers all point towards mammary epithelial cells involved in milk production. Therefore, the top cell types would be:

1. Mammary epithelial cells (or mammary gland secretory cells)
2. Alveolar epithelial cells (a subtype within mammary gland)
3. Lactating mammary epithelial cells

Alternatively, maybe the user expects more specific terms. Another thought: Wap and Lalba are specific markers for mammary alveolar cells during lactation. Caseins are also produced by these cells. Glycam1 might be expressed in other cell types, but in this context, it's likely part of the mammary gland.

Therefore, the top three cell types are all related to the mammary gland, perhaps different stages or subtypes. But since the user asks for top 3 cell types, maybe the answer is:

Mammary epithelial cell, Alveolar epithelial cell, Lactocyte

But I need to confirm. Lactocyte is a term sometimes used for milk-producing cells. Alternatively, in the mouse mammary gland, the main cell types are basal cells (myoepithelial) and luminal cells (which include secretory alveolar cells). So perhaps the top three are:

1. Luminal epithelial cells (mammary gland)
2. Alveolar epithelial cells
3. Secretory epithelial cells (mammary)

Alternatively, considering that all markers are for milk-producing cells, the answer might be three different names for the same cell type, but the user probably expects three distinct, albeit related, cell types. However, given the markers, they all point to the same primary cell type. In such cases, perhaps the user expects the top three as different mammary cell types. But I might need to list the same cell type three times, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe there's another cell type that expresses some of these genes. For example, salivary gland cells can produce some similar proteins, but caseins are specific to mammary. Lalba is also specific to mammary. Therefore, the answer is three mammary-related cell types. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the top three as:

1. Mammary epithelial cell
2. Secretory alveolar cell
3. Lactating mammary cell

But I need to check standard cell type nomenclature. In single-cell RNA studies of mouse mammary gland, common cell types include basal cells, luminal progenitor cells, and mature luminal cells (which include those expressing caseins and Lalba). So perhaps:

1. Mature luminal epithelial cell
2. Alveolar epithelial cell
3. Mammary secretory cell

Alternatively, another possibility: during pregnancy and lactation, the mammary gland differentiates into alveolar structures, so the cell types could be alveolar cells, ductal cells, and myoepithelial cells. But the markers here (caseins, Lalba) are specific to the secretory alveolar cells.

Given all this, the most likely top 3 cell types are all variations of mammary gland secretory cells. Since the user wants the top 3, separated by commas, I'll list the most specific terms first. 

Final Answer: Mammary epithelial cell, Alveolar epithelial cell, Lactocyte
</think>

Mammary epithelial cell, Alveolar epithelial cell, Lactocyte
