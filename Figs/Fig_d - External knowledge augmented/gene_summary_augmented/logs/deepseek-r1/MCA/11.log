Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Elane: Elastases form a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze many proteins in addition to elastin. Humans have six elastase genes which encode structurally similar proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the active protease. Following activation, this protease hydrolyzes proteins within specialized neutrophil lysosomes, called azurophil granules, as well as proteins of the extracellular matrix. The enzyme may play a role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases through proteolysis of collagen-IV and elastin. This protein also degrades the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli as well as the virulence factors of such bacteria as Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia. Mutations in this gene are associated with cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). This gene is present in a gene cluster on chromosome 19. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]
- Mpo: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme protein synthesized during myeloid differentiation that constitutes the major component of neutrophil azurophilic granules. Produced as a single chain precursor, myeloperoxidase is subsequently cleaved into a light and heavy chain. The mature myeloperoxidase is a tetramer composed of 2 light chains and 2 heavy chains. This enzyme produces hypohalous acids central to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Ctsg: The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the peptidase S1 protein family, is found in azurophil granules of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The encoded protease has a specificity similar to that of chymotrypsin C, and may participate in the killing and digestion of engulfed pathogens, and in connective tissue remodeling at sites of inflammation. In addition, the encoded protein is antimicrobial, with bacteriocidal activity against S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]
- Prtn3: Enables enzyme binding activity; serine-type endopeptidase activity; and signaling receptor binding activity. Involved in several processes, including mature conventional dendritic cell differentiation; membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis; and neutrophil extravasation. Located in azurophil granule lumen; cytosol; and plasma membrane raft. Colocalizes with plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ms4a3: This gene encodes a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family. Members of this protein family are characterized by common structural features and similar intron/exon splice boundaries and display unique expression patterns among hematopoietic cells and nonlymphoid tissues. This family member likely plays a role in signal transduction and may function as a subunit associated with receptor complexes. The gene encoding this protein is localized to 11q12, among a cluster of related family members. Alternative splicing may result in multiple transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ly6c2: Gene ID not found
- Plac8: Lysophospholipases are enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids. The protein encoded by this gene has lysophospholipase activity. It is composed of two identical subunits which are held together by disulfide bonds. This protein has structural similarity to several members of the beta-galactoside-binding S-type lectin family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Nkg7: Predicted to be integral component of plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Srgn: This gene encodes a protein best known as a hematopoietic cell granule proteoglycan. Proteoglycans stored in the secretory granules of many hematopoietic cells also contain a protease-resistant peptide core, which may be important for neutralizing hydrolytic enzymes. This encoded protein was found to be associated with the macromolecular complex of granzymes and perforin, which may serve as a mediator of granule-mediated apoptosis. Two transcript variants, only one of them protein-coding, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]
- Cst7: The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions. This gene encodes a glycosylated cysteine protease inhibitor with a putative role in immune regulation through inhibition of a unique target in the hematopoietic system. Expression of the protein has been observed in various human cancer cell lines established from malignant tumors. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on these markers: Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3, Ms4a3, Ly6c2, Plac8, Nkg7, Srgn, and Cst7. Let me start by going through each gene and their descriptions to see which cell types they're associated with.

First, Elane. The summary says it's involved in neutrophil lysosomes called azurophil granules. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell, so that points to neutrophils. Then Mpo, which is myeloperoxidase, also mentioned in neutrophil azurophilic granules. That's another neutrophil marker. Ctsg is found in azurophil granules of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are neutrophils. Prtn3 is located in azurophil granule lumen and involved in neutrophil extravasation. So all these genes (Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3) are strongly associated with neutrophils.

Ms4a3 is part of the membrane-spanning 4A family, which the note says is expressed in hematopoietic cells. I recall that Ms4a3 is often linked to myeloid cells, maybe neutrophils or their precursors. Ly6c2's gene info wasn't found, but Ly6c is a marker I've heard of for monocytes and some T cell subsets in mice. However, since other markers are pointing to neutrophils, maybe Ly6c2 here is part of a different subset? Plac8 has lysophospholipase activity, and while not specific, it's found in some immune cells. Nkg7 is predicted to be in the plasma membrane, maybe involved in NK cells or cytotoxic T cells. Srgn is associated with hematopoietic cell granules, like in cytotoxic T cells or NK cells. Cst7 is a cystatin involved in immune regulation, possibly in T cells or NK cells.

Wait, but the majority of the markers here (Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3, Ms4a3) are neutrophil-related. The others (Ly6c2, Plac8, Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7) might be part of other immune cells. But since the task is to find the top 3 cell types, and the strongest markers here are neutrophil-specific, the first is definitely neutrophils. 

Now, what about the other markers? Ms4a3 is also expressed in other myeloid cells. Cst7 is mentioned in cancer cell lines, but also immune regulation. Srgn is in granzymes and perforin, which are in cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Nkg7 could be NK cells. Ly6c2 (if similar to Ly6c) is in monocytes and some T cells. So maybe the second cell type is NK cells? But maybe there's another myeloid cell type here. Alternatively, monocytes/macrophages?

Wait, but Ms4a3 is specifically mentioned as being part of hematopoietic cells, perhaps myeloid lineage. Some sources indicate that Ms4a3 is a marker for granulocyte precursors. Also, considering that Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3 are all neutrophil granule proteins, and Ms4a3 is involved in myeloid differentiation. So perhaps the second cell type is neutrophil precursors or granulocytes. But maybe there's another cell type here. Alternatively, mast cells? But the markers don't seem to point there.

Alternatively, looking at Cst7 and Srgn, which are involved in cytotoxic granules. Srgn (serglycin) is found in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells. Nkg7 is associated with NK cells and CTLs. So maybe these markers are pointing towards NK cells or CTLs as a secondary cell type. But since the main markers are neutrophil, perhaps the second and third are other myeloid cells. For example, monocytes and dendritic cells? But the presence of Prtn3 (Proteinase 3) is more specific to neutrophils. Ms4a3 is also found in basophils and mast cells in some contexts, but again, the primary markers are neutrophil.

Wait, but Ly6c is a marker for inflammatory monocytes in mice. Ly6c2 might be similar. Plac8 is expressed in some dendritic cells and macrophages. But if the majority of markers are neutrophil, the top is definitely neutrophils. The other markers could indicate a mix, but maybe the second cell type is monocytes (since Ly6c2 and Plac8 could be in monocytes). Third, maybe NK cells because of Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, some of these markers could be in cytotoxic T cells. Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells? But I don't see DC-specific markers here.

Alternatively, maybe the second cell type is granulocytes (since neutrophils are a type of granulocyte, but perhaps others). Or eosinophils? But Mpo is not typically in eosinophils. Basophils? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of Ms4a3 and others could indicate a precursor cell, like granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. But I'm not certain. 

Another approach: look up standard markers. Neutrophils: Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3. Check. Then, for example, Ms4a3 is a marker for neutrophils and mast cells. Ly6c2 (if similar to Ly6c) is in monocytes. Plac8 is in dendritic cells and macrophages. Nkg7 in NK and T cells. Srgn in cytotoxic cells. Cst7 in T cells. So perhaps the second cell type is monocytes (based on Ly6c2, Plac8), and third is NK cells (Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7). But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the presence of multiple granule proteins (Srgn, Cst7) might indicate cytotoxic T cells. 

Wait, but the user is asking for mouse cell types. Let me think: in mice, Ly6c is a marker for monocytes (Ly6C high is inflammatory monocytes). Plac8 is found in some dendritic cells and macrophages. Nkg7 is expressed in NK cells and activated CD8+ T cells. Srgn is in cytotoxic granules. Cst7 is expressed in activated T cells.

So perhaps the markers here are a mix of neutrophils (Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3, Ms4a3), and some other cells with Ly6c2 (monocytes), Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7 (NK or T cells). But the majority of markers are neutrophil. So the top cell type is neutrophils. Then, the next question is: are there markers that point to another cell type? Like Ms4a3 might be in basophils or mast cells? Or perhaps the presence of multiple granule proteins in another cell type. Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a mix, but the question is about the top 3. Since Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3 are all neutrophil-specific, that's the first. The others might be part of other cells. So second could be NK cells (because of Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7), third could be monocytes (Ly6c2, Plac8). Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells (Plac8 is in some DC subsets). But I need to check. For example, Srgn is in cytotoxic cells. Let me check some references: 

Neutrophils: Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3, Ms4a3 (maybe). 
NK cells: Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7 (Cst7 is also in T cells). 
Monocytes: Ly6c2, Plac8 (Plac8 is in some DCs and macrophages too). 

Alternatively, if Ms4a3 is specific for neutrophils, then the top 3 would be: 1. Neutrophils, 2. NK cells, 3. Monocytes. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that Ms4a3 is in mast cells. But given that most of the markers are neutrophil, the top is definitely neutrophils. The next two could be NK cells and cytotoxic T cells. Or monocytes and NK cells. 

Alternatively, some of these markers are found in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. Ms4a3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors. But if the cell is a mature cell, then neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is a precursor cell. But the user probably expects mature cell types. 

Another angle: Check what each of these markers are known for. Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3 are all primary granules in neutrophils. Ms4a3 is also known as Htm4, which is expressed in granulocytes. So Ms4a3 is a marker for granulocytes, including neutrophils. 

Ly6c2: Ly6c is a marker for inflammatory monocytes. 

Plac8: Expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells. 

Nkg7: Found in NK cells and CD8+ T cells. 

Srgn: Serglycin, found in cytotoxic granules of T and NK cells. 

Cst7: Cystatin 7, expressed in activated T cells. 

So the presence of these markers could indicate that the cell has a mix of neutrophil markers and some other immune cells. But maybe the cell population is a neutrophil, and the other markers are either low or part of a different population. However, the task is to determine the top 3 cell types based on the presence of these markers. If all markers are expressed in the same cell, but some are specific to different cells, then it's contradictory, but perhaps the strongest signals are neutrophils, then maybe NK cells and monocytes. 

Alternatively, if the markers are from a single-cell dataset, the cell could be a neutrophil with some other markers expressed, but that's less likely. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Neutrophils (due to Elane, Mpo, Ctsg, Prtn3, Ms4a3)
2. Natural Killer (NK) cells (due to Nkg7, Srgn, Cst7)
3. Monocytes (due to Ly6c2, Plac8)

Alternatively, maybe Cytotoxic T cells instead of NK cells because of Srgn and Cst7, but Nkg7 is more NK-associated. 

So the final answer would be Neutrophils, NK cells, Monocytes. Alternatively, if Plac8 is more associated with dendritic cells, but I think Plac8 is also in monocytes. 

Another check: Srgn (serglycin) is in hematopoietic granules, including platelets, but mainly in cytotoxic cells. Cst7 is in T cells and NK cells. Nkg7 is more NK. 

So putting it all together, the top 3 would be:

1. Neutrophils
2. NK cells
3. Monocytes

Neutrophils, Natural Killer cells, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes
