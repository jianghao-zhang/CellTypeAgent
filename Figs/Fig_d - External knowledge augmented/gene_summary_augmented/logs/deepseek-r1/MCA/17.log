Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Fabp7: The gene encodes a small, highly conserved cytoplasmic protein that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. The encoded protein is important in the establishment of the radial glial fiber in the developing brain. Alternative splicing and promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on multiple chromosomes. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]
- Pantr1: Predicted to act upstream of or within regulation of gene expression. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Nnat: The protein encoded by this gene is a proteolipid that may be involved in the regulation of ion channels during brain development. The encoded protein may also play a role in forming and maintaining the structure of the nervous system. This gene is found within an intron of another gene, bladder cancer associated protein, but on the opposite strand. This gene is imprinted and is expressed only from the paternal allele. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]
- Ptn: The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted heparin-binding growth factor. The protein has significant roles in cell growth and survival, cell migration, angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]
- Pax6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular disorders such as aniridia and Peter's anomaly. Use of alternate promoters and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a particular alternate coding exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and alter its DNA binding specificity. Consequently, isoforms that carry the shorter paired box domain regulate a different set of genes compared to the isoforms carrying the longer paired box domain. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2019]
- Rtn1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene is considered to be a specific marker for neurological diseases and cancer, and is a potential molecular target for therapy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]
- Dbi: Present mainly in the mitochondrial compartment of peripheral tissues, the protein encoded by this gene interacts with some benzodiazepines and has different affinities than its endogenous counterpart. The protein is a key factor in the flow of cholesterol into mitochondria to permit the initiation of steroid hormone synthesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been reported; one of the variants lacks an internal exon and is considered non-coding, and the other variants encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]
- Tuba1a: Microtubules of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton perform essential and diverse functions and are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta tubulins. The genes encoding these microtubule constituents belong to the tubulin superfamily, which is composed of six distinct families. Genes from the alpha, beta and gamma tubulin families are found in all eukaryotes. The alpha and beta tubulins represent the major components of microtubules, while gamma tubulin plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly. There are multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes, which are highly conserved among species. This gene encodes alpha tubulin and is highly similar to the mouse and rat Tuba1 genes. Northern blot studies have shown that the gene expression is predominantly found in morphologically differentiated neurologic cells. This gene is one of three alpha-tubulin genes in a cluster on chromosome 12q. Mutations in this gene cause lissencephaly type 3 (LIS3) - a neurological condition characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early-onset epilepsy caused by defective neuronal migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]
- H2afv: Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a replication-independent histone that is a member of the histone H2A family. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms, have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]
- Tubb2b: The protein encoded by this gene is a beta isoform of tubulin, which binds GTP and is a major component of microtubules. This gene is highly similar to TUBB2A and TUBB2C. Defects in this gene are a cause of asymmetric polymicrogyria. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]

Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Fabp7, Pantr1, Nnat, Ptn, Pax6, Rtn1, Dbi, Tuba1a, H2afv, Tubb2b.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall what cell types they are associated with. 

Starting with Fabp7. From the description, it's involved in the developing brain and radial glial fibers. Radial glial cells are progenitors in the nervous system, so maybe neural stem cells or astrocytes. Fabp7 is a known marker for astrocytes and radial glial cells.

Pantr1: The info provided says it's involved in gene expression regulation, but I'm not sure about specific cell types. Maybe a general marker for progenitor cells or something else. Not sure, might need to check other markers.

Nnat: This gene is imprinted, expressed from the paternal allele, involved in brain development and nervous system structure. It's associated with neurons, maybe specific types like hypothalamic neurons or neuroendocrine cells.

Ptn: A growth factor involved in cell growth, migration, angiogenesis. PTN is expressed in various cells, including neural cells, endothelial cells, and some cancers. Maybe neural progenitor cells or glial cells.

Pax6: Critical for eye development and neural tissues. Pax6 is a key transcription factor in neurogenesis, especially in the retina, lens, and central nervous system. It's a marker for progenitor cells in the CNS and retinal cells.

Rtn1: Part of the reticulon family, associated with endoplasmic reticulum, involved in neuroendocrine secretion. Reticulons are markers for neurons and neuroendocrine cells.

Dbi: Involved in steroid hormone synthesis, interacts with benzodiazepines. Expressed in tissues that produce steroids, like adrenal glands, but also found in astrocytes. DBI is known in astrocytes and possibly other glial cells.

Tuba1a and Tubb2b: Both are tubulins. Tuba1a is a neuronal-specific tubulin, mutations cause lissencephaly. Tubb2b is also a beta tubulin isoform found in neurons. These are strong neuronal markers.

H2afv: A histone H2A variant, replication-independent. Histones are in all cells, but replication-independent variants are often in post-mitotic cells like neurons.

Putting this together:

- Neuronal markers: Tuba1a, Tubb2b, Rtn1, Nnat, H2afv (since replication-independent histones are in non-dividing cells like neurons)
- Glial/astrocyte markers: Fabp7, Dbi, maybe Ptn
- Progenitor cells: Pax6 (neural progenitors), Fabp7 (radial glial)

So the top cell types would likely be neurons (from Tuba1a, Tubb2b), astrocytes (Fabp7, Dbi), and neural progenitor cells (Pax6, Fabp7).

Now, ranking them. Neurons have multiple markers (Tuba1a, Tubb2b, Rtn1, Nnat, H2afv), which are very specific. Then astrocytes (Fabp7, Dbi). Then neural progenitors (Pax6). However, Pax6 is also in mature cells like in the eye. Alternatively, considering radial glial cells (Fabp7, which are progenitors), so maybe radial glia as progenitors. Another possibility is neuroendocrine cells due to Rtn1 and Dbi, but Dbi is also in astrocytes.

So the top 3 cell types might be: Neurons, Astrocytes, Neural Progenitor Cells. But need to check if any other cells fit better. For example, Pax6 is also in retinal cells, but if the markers are from brain, then neural progenitors. Alternatively, radial glial cells as the third.

Alternatively, given that Tubb2b and Tuba1a are neuronal, Fabp7 is astrocyte/radial glial, Pax6 as neural progenitor. So the order could be Neurons, Astrocytes, Neural Progenitor Cells. But I need to confirm if any other cell types are indicated. For example, H2afv might suggest post-mitotic neurons, which reinforces neurons. Pantr1 is unclear but maybe in progenitors. Ptn might be in neural stem cells or other glial cells.

So the most probable top 3: Neurons, Astrocytes, Neural Progenitor Cells.
