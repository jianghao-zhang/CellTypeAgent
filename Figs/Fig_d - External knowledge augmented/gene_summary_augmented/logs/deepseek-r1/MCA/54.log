Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these markers. Hmm, the user provided a list of genes, but all the Gene IDs from NCBI are not found. That's a bit confusing. Maybe these are old symbols or aliases? Let me think about each gene.

Starting with Tpbpa and Tpbpb. I recall that Tpbpa is also known as Mafa (Mammalian APJ Associated) or sometimes as Trophoblast specific protein alpha. Similarly, Tpbpb might be Trophoblast specific protein beta. These are markers associated with trophoblast cells in the placenta. So maybe placental trophoblasts?

Next, the Prl genes: Prl3b1, Prl2b1, Prl8a9, Prl8a8. Prl stands for Prolactin-like proteins. In mice, the prolactin family includes many members expressed in the placenta, especially in trophoblast cells. For example, Prl3b1 is known as Prolactin-like protein E, and Prl2b1 might be another variant. These are typically expressed in trophoblast giant cells or other placental cell types.

Ceacam11, Ceacam14, Ceacam12: CEACAM stands for Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Related Cell Adhesion Molecule. Some CEACAM family members are expressed in the placenta as well. For instance, CEACAMs in mice can be found in trophoblasts. Psg21 is Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 21. PSG genes are part of the CEACAM family and are predominantly expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy.

Putting this together, all these markers are highly specific to placental cells, particularly various trophoblast subtypes. Trophoblast cells differentiate into different types like giant cells, spongiotrophoblasts, and syncytiotrophoblasts. Tpbpa is a marker for spongiotrophoblast, while Tpbpb is for trophoblast giant cells. The Prl genes are often in giant cells. CEACAMs and PSG are in syncytiotrophoblasts or other trophoblast layers.

So the top three cell types would be different trophoblast cells. The most probable order might be:

1. Trophoblast Giant Cells (since Tpbpb/Prl genes are prominent here)
2. Spongiotrophoblasts (Tpbpa is a key marker)
3. Syncytiotrophoblasts (CEACAM and PSG markers)

Trophoblast Giant Cells, Spongiotrophoblasts, Syncytiotrophoblasts
