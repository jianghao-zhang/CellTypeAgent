Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Tpm1: This gene is a member of the tropomyosin family of highly conserved, widely distributed actin-binding proteins involved in the contractile system of striated and smooth muscles and the cytoskeleton of non-muscle cells. Tropomyosin is composed of two alpha-helical chains arranged as a coiled-coil. It is polymerized end to end along the two grooves of actin filaments and provides stability to the filaments. The encoded protein is one type of alpha helical chain that forms the predominant tropomyosin of striated muscle, where it also functions in association with the troponin complex to regulate the calcium-dependent interaction of actin and myosin during muscle contraction. In smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a range of isoforms have been described. Mutations in this gene are associated with type 3 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy 1Y. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2022]
- Mdk: This gene encodes a member of a small family of secreted growth factors that binds heparin and responds to retinoic acid. The encoded protein promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, in particular during tumorigenesis. This gene has been targeted as a therapeutic for a variety of different disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]
- Tceal9: The globular WW domain is composed of 38 to 40 semiconserved amino acids shared by proteins of diverse functions including structural, regulatory, and signaling proteins. The domain is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions through the binding of polyproline ligands. This gene encodes a WW domain binding protein. This gene also encodes a domain with similarity to the transcription elongation factor A, SII-related family. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding a single isoform. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tcf21: TCF21 encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family. The TCF21 product is mesoderm specific, and expressed in embryonic epicardium, mesenchyme-derived tissues of lung, gut, gonad, and both mesenchymal and glomerular epithelial cells in the kidney. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Dlk1: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats that functions as a regulator of cell growth. The encoded protein is involved in the differentiation of several cell types including adipocytes. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 14 frequently showing unparental disomy, and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. A single nucleotide variant in this gene is associated with child and adolescent obesity and shows polar overdominance, where heterozygotes carrying an active paternal allele express the phenotype, while mutant homozygotes are normal. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Tsc22d1: This gene encodes a member of the TSC22 domain family of leucine zipper transcription factors. The encoded protein is stimulated by transforming growth factor beta, and regulates the transcription of multiple genes including C-type natriuretic peptide. The encoded protein may play a critical role in tumor suppression through the induction of cancer cell apoptosis, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of this gene has been associated with diabetic nephropathy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Maged2: This gene is a member of the MAGED gene family. The MAGED genes are clustered on chromosome Xp11. This gene is located in Xp11.2, a hot spot for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Mutations in this gene cause a form of transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome. This gene may also be involved in several types of cancer, including breast cancer and melanoma. The protein encoded by this gene is progressively recruited from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm during the interphase and after nucleolar stress and is thus thought to play a role in cell cycle regulation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]
- Rpl13: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L13E family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. This gene is expressed at significantly higher levels in benign breast lesions than in breast carcinomas. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]
- Serpinh1: This gene encodes a member of the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors. The encoded protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in collagen biosynthesis as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone. Autoantibodies to the encoded protein have been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Expression of this gene may be a marker for cancer, and nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with preterm birth caused by preterm premature rupture of membranes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]
- Meg3: This gene is a maternally expressed imprinted gene. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been transcribed from this gene and all of them are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This gene is expressed in many normal tissues, but its expression is lost in multiple cancer cell lines of various tissue origins. It inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro. It also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, and regulates p53 target gene expression. Its deletion enhances angiogenesis in vivo. Many experimental evidences demonstrate that this gene is a lncRNA tumor suppressor. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers provided are Tpm1, Mdk, Tceal9, Tcf21, Dlk1, Tsc22d1, Maged2, Rpl13, Serpinh1, and Meg3. 

First, I should go through each gene and recall what cell types they are associated with. Let's start with Tpm1. From the summary, Tpm1 is part of the tropomyosin family involved in muscle cells. It's predominant in striated muscle, so that suggests muscle cells like cardiomyocytes or skeletal muscle cells.

Mdk (Midkine) is a growth factor involved in cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, often associated with tumors. But in normal tissues, it might be in certain epithelial cells or macrophages. Maybe endothelial cells too because of angiogenesis.

Tceal9 has a WW domain, involved in protein interactions. Not sure about this one. Maybe some regulatory cells, possibly in the nucleus. Maybe stem cells or certain epithelial cells? Not too clear.

Tcf21 is a transcription factor expressed in mesenchyme-derived tissues like lung, gut, gonad, and kidney. This sounds like a mesenchymal cell marker, maybe fibroblasts or stromal cells. Could be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Dlk1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation and is imprinted. It's associated with preadipocytes or certain stem cells. Maybe stromal cells in adipose tissue.

Tsc22d1 is a transcription factor involved in apoptosis, possibly in tumor suppression. Found in various tissues, maybe immune cells or epithelial cells?

Maged2 is linked to cell cycle regulation and is associated with cancer. Mutations cause Bartter's syndrome, which affects kidney function. So maybe kidney cells, like renal epithelial cells.

Rpl13 is a ribosomal protein. High expression in benign breast lesions. Ribosomal proteins are in all cells, but higher in rapidly dividing cells? Maybe cancer cells, but the user is asking for normal mouse cells. Possibly proliferating cells or certain secretory cells.

Serpinh1 is a serpin involved in collagen biosynthesis, acting as a chaperone in the ER. Found in fibroblasts, especially those producing collagen, like in connective tissue. Also linked to rheumatoid arthritis, so maybe synovial fibroblasts?

Meg3 is a maternally expressed imprinted lncRNA, a tumor suppressor. Expressed in many normal tissues but lost in cancers. It's involved in angiogenesis. Maybe endothelial cells or certain stem cells?

Now, let's try to group these markers. Tpm1 is strong for muscle. Tcf21 for mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, stromal). Serpinh1 also points to fibroblasts (collagen production). Dlk1 for adipocyte precursors. Mdk might be endothelial or epithelial. Tsc22d1 and Maged2 are a bit broad. Rpl13 is in many cells but maybe not specific. Meg3 could be in endothelial or other cells. Tceal9 not sure.

Top candidates: Muscle cells (Tpm1), Fibroblasts (Tcf21, Serpinh1), Adipocytes (Dlk1), maybe endothelial (Mdk). But let's check:

Muscle cells (Tpm1 is a key marker here) likely first. Fibroblasts (Tcf21 and Serpinh1) next. Adipocytes (Dlk1) third. Mdk might be in endothelial but not sure if that's enough. Alternatively, if Tcf21 is more specific to certain mesenchymal cells, maybe fibroblasts. Maybe Serpinh1 is in fibroblasts too. So combining these, the top three would be:

1. Muscle cells (smooth or striated)
2. Fibroblasts
3. Adipocytes

Alternatively, if Mdk is indicative of endothelial cells, but the presence of Tcf21 and Serpinh1 for fibroblasts might be stronger. So the list would be Muscle, Fibroblasts, Adipocytes.
