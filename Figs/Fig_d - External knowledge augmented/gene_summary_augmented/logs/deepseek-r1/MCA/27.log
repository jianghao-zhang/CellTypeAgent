Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Prtn3: Enables enzyme binding activity; serine-type endopeptidase activity; and signaling receptor binding activity. Involved in several processes, including mature conventional dendritic cell differentiation; membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis; and neutrophil extravasation. Located in azurophil granule lumen; cytosol; and plasma membrane raft. Colocalizes with plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Cmtm7: This gene belongs to the chemokine-like factor gene superfamily, a novel family that is similar to the chemokine and transmembrane 4 superfamilies. This gene is one of several chemokine-like factor genes located in a cluster on chromosome 3. This gene acts as a tumor suppressor that regulates G1/S transition in the cell cycle, and epidermal growth factor receptor/protein kinase B signaling during tumor pathogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]
- H2afy: Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a replication-independent histone that is a member of the histone H2A family. It replaces conventional H2A histones in a subset of nucleosomes where it represses transcription and participates in stable X chromosome inactivation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]
- Mpo: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme protein synthesized during myeloid differentiation that constitutes the major component of neutrophil azurophilic granules. Produced as a single chain precursor, myeloperoxidase is subsequently cleaved into a light and heavy chain. The mature myeloperoxidase is a tetramer composed of 2 light chains and 2 heavy chains. This enzyme produces hypohalous acids central to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Plac8: Lysophospholipases are enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids. The protein encoded by this gene has lysophospholipase activity. It is composed of two identical subunits which are held together by disulfide bonds. This protein has structural similarity to several members of the beta-galactoside-binding S-type lectin family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ctsg: The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the peptidase S1 protein family, is found in azurophil granules of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The encoded protease has a specificity similar to that of chymotrypsin C, and may participate in the killing and digestion of engulfed pathogens, and in connective tissue remodeling at sites of inflammation. In addition, the encoded protein is antimicrobial, with bacteriocidal activity against S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]
- Emb: This cell-cycle-regulated gene encodes a protein that mediates leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent protein transport. The protein specifically inhibits the nuclear export of Rev and U snRNAs. It is involved in the control of several cellular processes by controlling the localization of cyclin B, MPAK, and MAPKAP kinase 2. This protein also regulates NFAT and AP-1. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2015]
- Gmfg: Predicted to enable Arp2/3 complex binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin filament debranching and negative regulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation. Predicted to be located in extracellular region; ficolin-1-rich granule lumen; and secretory granule lumen. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ptprcap: The protein encoded by this gene was identified as a transmembrane phosphoprotein specifically associated with tyrosine phosphatase PTPRC/CD45, a key regulator of T- and B-lymphocyte activation. The interaction with PTPRC may be required for the stable expression of this protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these markers. I remember that each cell type has specific markers, so I'll go through each gene and see which ones are associated with which cells.

Starting with Prtn3. The description mentions involvement in neutrophil extravasation and located in azurophil granules. Neutrophils have azurophilic granules, so Prtn3 might be a neutrophil marker.

Next, Mpo. Myeloperoxidase is a well-known marker for neutrophils. It's in azurophilic granules too. So that's another point for neutrophils.

Ctsg is mentioned as being in neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are neutrophils. So Ctsg is another neutrophil marker. So far, that's three genes pointing to neutrophils. So neutrophils are probably first.

Plac8. I think Plac8 is associated with macrophages or dendritic cells. Wait, the description says it has lysophospholipase activity and is similar to S-type lectins. Some macrophages express lectins, maybe? Or maybe dendritic cells. Not sure yet.

H2afy is a histone variant. Histones are in all cells, but H2afy replaces H2A in some nucleosomes. Maybe in cells that are rapidly dividing? Or stem cells? Not sure. Maybe involved in certain immune cells?

Cmtm7 is part of the chemokine-like family and acts as a tumor suppressor. It's involved in cell cycle regulation. Some T cells or other lymphocytes might express this? Or maybe dendritic cells?

Ptprcap is associated with CD45, which is a pan-leukocyte marker, especially in lymphocytes. CD45 is a tyrosine phosphatase critical for T and B cell activation. Ptprcap interacts with CD45, so this might be in T or B cells.

Emb gene is involved in nuclear export, cell cycle control. Maybe in proliferating cells, like activated lymphocytes or stem cells.

Gmfg is involved in actin regulation, found in secretory granules. Maybe in granulocytes or cytotoxic T cells/NK cells with granules.

AI662270 isn't found, so I can ignore that.

So, putting this together: The strongest markers are Prtn3, Mpo, Ctsg which are all neutrophil markers. Then, Ptprcap is linked to CD45, which is in lymphocytes. But wait, CD45 is in all leukocytes, but Ptprcap is specifically interacting with it in T and B cells. So maybe Ptprcap is more specific for lymphocytes. 

If the main markers are neutrophils (Prtn3, Mpo, Ctsg), then maybe the first cell type is Neutrophils. Then, looking at other genes: Plac8 might be in macrophages or dendritic cells. Cmtm7 in dendritic cells? Since Prtn3 is involved in dendritic cell differentiation. Hmm, Prtn3's description says involved in mature conventional dendritic cell differentiation. So maybe dendritic cells are another cell type here. So Prtn3 is in both neutrophils and dendritic cells? But Mpo and Ctsg are more specific to neutrophils. 

Another gene, Gmfg, is in secretory granules. Maybe in granulocytes, so again neutrophils. But could also be in other granulocytes like eosinophils or basophils, but Mpo is more specific to neutrophils. 

So the top three cell types would be:

1. Neutrophils (due to Prtn3, Mpo, Ctsg)
2. Dendritic cells (due to Prtn3's role in differentiation and maybe Cmtm7)
3. T cells or B cells (due to Ptprcap's association with CD45). Alternatively, maybe macrophages for Plac8?

But Plac8's lysophospholipase activity and similarity to lectinsâ€”maybe macrophages or dendritic cells. 

Alternatively, if Ptprcap is specific to lymphocytes, then T cells. So possible ranking could be Neutrophils, Dendritic Cells, T cells. But I need to check if other markers support this. 

Cmtm7 is a chemokine-like factor, which might be in dendritic cells. H2afy is a histone variant, maybe in cells with active transcription, like activated lymphocytes or dendritic cells. 

So, considering all markers, the top three cell types would likely be:

1. Neutrophils (strong markers)
2. Dendritic cells (Prtn3, Cmtm7)
3. T cells (Ptprcap)

Alternatively, maybe macrophages for the third? But Plac8 is also in some studies associated with macrophages. Hmm. Let me think again. Ptprcap is linked to CD45, which is in all leukocytes but especially T and B cells. So Ptprcap might indicate T or B cells. 

So the top three might be: Neutrophils, Dendritic cells, T cells. 

Alternatively, if Cmtm7 is more in dendritic cells, and Ptprcap in lymphocytes, then those three. 

Another possibility: The presence of Plac8 and Gmfg could point towards other granulocytes or macrophages. But given the main markers, neutrophils are clear first. Maybe dendritic cells second, and T cells third. Alternatively, macrophages third. 

But I need to check the exact markers. Let me recall:

- Neutrophils: MPO, CTSG, PRTN3 (these are classic markers)
- Dendritic cells: PRTN3 (involved in their differentiation), maybe CMTM7
- T cells: PTPRCAP (CD45 associated)
- Macrophages: PLAC8 (possible)

But I'm not sure about Plac8. Some sources say Plac8 is expressed in macrophages. For example, PLAC8 is known as onzin and is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells. 

So, possible cell types: Neutrophils, Dendritic cells, Macrophages. Alternatively, T cells. 

Alternatively, maybe B cells? Ptprcap is in B cells as well. But without more specific markers, it's hard. 

Given the information, I think the top three are:

Neutrophils, Dendritic Cells, T cells. 

But maybe macrophages instead of T cells. 

Alternatively, another possibility: The presence of H2afy (a histone variant) might be in stem cells or progenitor cells, but that's less likely. 

So, given the markers, the most likely ranking would be:

1. Neutrophils
2. Dendritic cells
3. Macrophages or T cells. 

But considering Ptprcap's association with CD45, which is prominent in T cells, maybe T cells. 

Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells and macrophages are both present. 

Alternatively, the third could be monocytes, since monocytes can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. But monocyte markers like CD14 are not listed here. 

Alternatively, given that Cmtm7 is a tumor suppressor in cell cycle, maybe in dendritic cells. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are Neutrophils, Dendritic Cells, and T cells. 

So the answer would be: Neutrophils, Dendritic cells, T cells.
