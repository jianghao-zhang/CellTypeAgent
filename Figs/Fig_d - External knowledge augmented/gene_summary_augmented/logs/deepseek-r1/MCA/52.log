Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Prss34: Gene ID not found
- Mcpt8: Gene ID not found
- Prg2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Cpa3: This gene encodes a member of the carboxypeptidase A family of zinc metalloproteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate a mature protease that is released by mast cells and may be involved in the degradation of endogenous proteins and the inactivation of venom-associated peptides. Expression of this gene may be elevated in human asthma patients. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Fcer1a: The immunoglobulin epsilon receptor (IgE receptor) is the initiator of the allergic response. When two or more high-affinity IgE receptors are brought together by allergen-bound IgE molecules, mediators such as histamine that are responsible for allergy symptoms are released. This receptor is comprised of an alpha subunit, a beta subunit, and two gamma subunits. The protein encoded by this gene represents the alpha subunit. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Ms4a2: The allergic response involves the binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE followed by cell activation and the release of mediators responsible for the manifestations of allergy. The IgE-receptor, a tetramer composed of an alpha, beta, and 2 disulfide-linked gamma chains, is found on the surface of mast cells and basophils. This gene encodes the beta subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor which is a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family. Members of this nascent protein family are characterized by common structural features and similar intron/exon splice boundaries and display unique expression patterns among hematopoietic cells and nonlymphoid tissues. This family member is localized to 11q12, among a cluster of membrane-spanning 4A gene family members. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins. Additional transcript variants have been described but require experimental validation. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]
- Srgn: This gene encodes a protein best known as a hematopoietic cell granule proteoglycan. Proteoglycans stored in the secretory granules of many hematopoietic cells also contain a protease-resistant peptide core, which may be important for neutralizing hydrolytic enzymes. This encoded protein was found to be associated with the macromolecular complex of granzymes and perforin, which may serve as a mediator of granule-mediated apoptosis. Two transcript variants, only one of them protein-coding, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]
- Cd200r3: Gene ID not found
- Ifitm1: Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of interferon induced antiviral proteins. The family contains five members, including IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 that belong to the CD225 superfamily. The protein encoded by this gene restricts cellular entry by diverse viral pathogens, such as influenza A virus, Ebola virus and Sars-CoV-2. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2021]
- Gata2: This gene encodes a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription factors that are named for the consensus nucleotide sequence they bind in the promoter regions of target genes. The encoded protein plays an essential role in regulating transcription of genes involved in the development and proliferation of hematopoietic and endocrine cell lineages. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]

Okay, let's see. The user provided a list of mouse marker genes and wants the top 3 cell types ranked by likelihood. Let me go through each gene and see what cell types they are associated with.

Starting with Prss34: Gene ID not found. Not sure about this one. Maybe a typo or an obscure gene. I'll skip it for now.

Mcpt8: Also not found. Hmm. Wait, Mcpt8 might be a mast cell protease? Maybe mast cells? But since the ID wasn't found, maybe it's a specific marker. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to Mcpt8 which is known in mast cells. But since the info isn't here, I'll note that.

Prg2: The summary says it's a major component of eosinophil granules. So eosinophils. Also mentions placenta and pregnancy serum, but the main cell type here is eosinophils.

Cpa3: Carboxypeptidase A3, associated with mast cells. The description mentions mast cells releasing it. So mast cells.

Fcer1a: High-affinity IgE receptor alpha subunit. Found on mast cells and basophils. So both cell types.

Ms4a2: Beta subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRIβ). Also present in mast cells and basophils. So same as Fcer1a.

Srgn: Serglycin, involved in granule proteoglycan in hematopoietic cells, associated with granzymes and perforin. Found in cytotoxic cells like NK cells, T cells, mast cells. But more associated with mast cells and basophils maybe.

Cd200r3: Not found. Maybe a receptor related to Cd200, which is involved in immune regulation. Not sure.

Ifitm1: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1, involved in antiviral response. More general, found in various immune cells, maybe dendritic cells or others. Not sure if specific.

Gata2: Transcription factor important for hematopoietic development. Important in mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and other hematopoietic lineages.

Putting this together: Prg2 (eosinophils), Cpa3 (mast cells), Fcer1a and Ms4a2 (mast cells/basophils). Srgn could be in mast cells or others. Gata2 is a transcription factor for these lineages. Mcpt8 might be mast cell-related. 

So the strongest markers are Prg2 (eosinophils), Cpa3 (mast cells), Fcer1a and Ms4a2 (mast cells and basophils). Since multiple markers point to mast cells (Cpa3, Fcer1a, Ms4a2), mast cells are likely first. Then eosinophils (Prg2). Then basophils (since Fcer1a and Ms4a2 are also in basophils). But Srgn and Gata2 may support these as well. Alternatively, maybe basophils come after mast cells and eosinophils. Wait, but basophils and mast cells both have some markers. Alternatively, maybe the top three are mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. Let me check the usual markers. 

Mast cell markers: Cpa3, Mcpt (like Mcpt8 if that's a typo), Fcer1a, Ms4a2. Eosinophils: Prg2 (major), also Gata2. Basophils: Ms4a2, Fcer1a, maybe Cd200r3 (if that's a basophil marker). But Cd200r3 is not found here. Gata2 is involved in development of basophils and mast cells. So putting it all together, the top three are Mast cells (most markers), Eosinophils (Prg2), and Basophils (Fcer1a, Ms4a2, Gata2). Alternatively, maybe Mast cells first, then Basophils, then Eosinophils? Wait, but Prg2 is specific to eosinophils. So presence of Prg2 would strongly indicate eosinophils. So the order would be Mast cells (Cpa3, Fcer1a, Ms4a2), Eosinophils (Prg2), then Basophils (Fcer1a, Ms4a2 but not Cpa3). Since both Mast and Basophils share Fcer1a and Ms4a2, but Cpa3 is specific to mast cells. So the presence of Cpa3 would indicate mast cells as first. Then Prg2 for eosinophils. Basophils would be third. Alternatively, another cell type? Let me check Srgn. Srgn is serglycin, which is in mast cells, basophils, and cytotoxic T cells/NK cells. So maybe. Ifitm1 is more general. So other possibilities? But with the given markers, the top three are Mast cells, Eosinophils, Basophils. So the answer should be Mast cells, Eosinophils, Basophils.
