Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Wfdc2: This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the WFDC domain family. The WFDC domain, or WAP Signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor in many family members. This gene is expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, and was also found to be expressed in some ovarian cancers. The encoded protein is a small secretory protein, which may be involved in sperm maturation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Mdk: This gene encodes a member of a small family of secreted growth factors that binds heparin and responds to retinoic acid. The encoded protein promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, in particular during tumorigenesis. This gene has been targeted as a therapeutic for a variety of different disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]
- H19: This gene is located in an imprinted region of chromosome 11 near the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. This gene is only expressed from the maternally-inherited chromosome, whereas IGF2 is only expressed from the paternally-inherited chromosome. The product of this gene is a long non-coding RNA which functions as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and Wilms tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015]
- Mif: This gene encodes a lymphokine involved in cell-mediated immunity, immunoregulation, and inflammation. It plays a role in the regulation of macrophage function in host defense through the suppression of anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. This lymphokine and the JAB1 protein form a complex in the cytosol near the peripheral plasma membrane, which may indicate an additional role in integrin signaling pathways. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Cldn6: Tight junctions represent one mode of cell-to-cell adhesion in epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, forming continuous seals around cells and serving as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space. These junctions are comprised of sets of continuous networking strands in the outwardly facing cytoplasmic leaflet, with complementary grooves in the inwardly facing extracytoplasmic leaflet. This gene encodes a component of tight junction strands, which is a member of the claudin family. The protein is an integral membrane protein and is one of the entry cofactors for hepatitis C virus. The gene methylation may be involved in esophageal tumorigenesis. This gene is adjacent to another family member CLDN9 on chromosome 16.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
- Cdk4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Bex4: This gene is a member of the brain expressed X-linked gene family. The proteins encoded by some of the other members of this family act as transcription elongation factors which allow RNA polymerase II to escape pausing during elongation. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Hmgn1: The protein encoded by this gene binds nucleosomal DNA and is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Along with a similar protein, HMG17, the encoded protein may help maintain an open chromatin configuration around transcribable genes. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Cldn7: This gene encodes a member of the claudin family. Claudins are integral membrane proteins and components of tight junction strands. Tight junction strands serve as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space between epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, and also play critical roles in maintaining cell polarity and signal transductions. Differential expression of this gene has been observed in different types of malignancies, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, urinary tumors, prostate cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancers, thyroid carcinomas, etc.. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010]
- Epcam: This gene encodes a carcinoma-associated antigen and is a member of a family that includes at least two type I membrane proteins. This antigen is expressed on most normal epithelial cells and gastrointestinal carcinomas and functions as a homotypic calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule. The antigen is being used as a target for immunotherapy treatment of human carcinomas. Mutations in this gene result in congenital tufting enteropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these markers. I need to go through each gene and see which cell types they're associated with. 

Starting with Wfdc2: The description mentions it's expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells and ovarian cancers. So maybe epithelial cells, especially in the lung or ovary.

Mdk is a growth factor involved in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. I've heard that Mdk is sometimes associated with certain stem cells or maybe endothelial cells because of angiogenesis, but also might be in cancer cells.

H19 is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, a lncRNA acting as a tumor suppressor. It's often linked to embryonic stem cells or germ cells, maybe placental cells too. But since it's involved in Beckwith-Wiedemann and Wilms tumor, perhaps some proliferative cell types.

Mif is a lymphokine involved in macrophage function and inflammation. So macrophages or other immune cells like T cells might express this.

Cldn6 and Cldn7 are claudins, part of tight junctions in epithelial cells. Claudins are definitely markers for epithelial cells. Different claudins might be in different epithelial tissues. Cldn6 is mentioned in esophageal tumorigenesis and HCV entry, maybe liver or gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Cldn7 is found in various carcinomas, so again epithelial.

Cdk4 is a cell cycle regulator, involved in G1-S phase. This is more general, expressed in proliferating cells. So maybe stem cells, cancer cells, or any rapidly dividing cell type.

Bex4 is part of a brain-expressed X-linked family. The description says some members are transcription elongation factors. So maybe neuronal cells? But the user specified mouse cells, so possible neural stem cells or neurons?

Hmgn1 binds nucleosomal DNA and is associated with active chromatin, so maybe stem cells or cells with high transcriptional activity, like embryonic stem cells or certain progenitor cells.

Epcam is a well-known epithelial cell adhesion molecule, highly expressed in epithelial cells and carcinomas. Definitely a strong epithelial marker.

Putting this together: The presence of Epcam and multiple claudins (Cldn6, Cldn7) strongly points to epithelial cells. Wfdc2 also supports epithelial (pulmonary). Mdk and H19 might indicate some stem cell properties or cancer cells. Mif suggests possible immune cells, but since other markers are more epithelial, maybe tumor-associated macrophages? But the other markers are more epithelial. Cdk4 suggests proliferation, so maybe a stem or progenitor cell type. Hmgn1 again might be in stem cells. Bex4 could be neuronal, but not sure. However, the strongest markers here are Epcam and Claudins, so epithelial cells are likely top. Then considering H19 and Mdk, maybe embryonic stem cells or some cancer stem cells? Alternatively, ovarian surface epithelial cells (since Wfdc2 is in ovarian cancers). Alternatively, pulmonary epithelial cells from Wfdc2. 

But since Epcam is a general epithelial marker, the top cell type is likely epithelial cells. Then, considering Cldn6 and Cldn7, maybe specific epithelial subtypes. For example, Clara cells in the lung (since Wfdc2 is in pulmonary), or ovarian epithelial cells. Alternatively, since H19 is involved in imprinting and embryonic development, maybe trophoblast cells or placental cells. But also, H19 is expressed in some stem cells. 

Alternatively, considering Epcam and Claudins, maybe intestinal epithelial cells? But Wfdc2 is more lung. Another angle: Mdk is involved in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. If these are cancer cells, maybe a carcinoma cell line (since Epcam is carcinoma-associated). So possible top cell types: 1. Epithelial cells (lung or ovarian surface), 2. Cancer stem cells, 3. Trophoblast cells or embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, considering the combination, maybe the top three are: Ovarian surface epithelial cells, Pulmonary epithelial cells, and some type of carcinoma cells (like hepatocellular or others). 

Wait, but the user says "mouse cells" in general. So perhaps the most common cell types with these markers. Epcam is epithelial, so epithelial cells. Then, given Wfdc2 in pulmonary and ovarian, maybe lung epithelial cells and ovarian epithelial cells. But how to rank? Mdk is also in some stem cells. But without more context, the strongest markers are Epcam and Claudins, so epithelial cells. Then perhaps stem cells (due to H19, Mdk, Cdk4, Hmgn1). Alternatively, tumor cells (since many markers are cancer-associated). So possible ranking: 1. Epithelial cells, 2. Cancer cells (like carcinoma), 3. Embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, maybe specific types like ovarian cancer cells, lung epithelial cells, and trophoblasts. 

Alternatively, considering the combination of Epcam, Claudins, and Wfdc2, the top cell type is epithelial. Then, given H19 and Mdk, maybe embryonic stem cells. Third could be trophoblasts or some glandular epithelial cells. Alternatively, since H19 is imprinted and maternally expressed, maybe placental cells. 

Alternatively, if thinking about normal cell types, the top three might be: 1. Pulmonary epithelial cells (Wfdc2), 2. Intestinal epithelial cells (Claudins and Epcam), 3. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4). But H19 is also in some other cells. Alternatively, trophoblast stem cells. 

Alternatively, considering the presence of multiple claudins and Epcam, maybe the cell type is a simple epithelium, like those in the gut or lung. Then, H19 might be in stem cells or progenitor cells. Cdk4 suggests proliferation, so maybe a progenitor cell type. Mdk could be in neural cells, but Bex4 is brain-expressed. Wait, Bex4 is part of a brain-expressed family, so maybe some neural cells, but Epcam is epithelial. So perhaps this is a mix of markers from different cell types, but the strongest are epithelial. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a cancer cell line derived from epithelial cells (Epcam, Claudins) with some stem-like properties (H19, Cdk4, Mdk). But the question is about cell types, not cancer vs normal. So maybe the top three are: 1. Epithelial cells (lung or ovarian), 2. Embryonic stem cells, 3. Trophoblast cells. 

Alternatively, considering that H19 is highly expressed in embryonic tissues and some cancers, maybe embryonic stem cells, then epithelial cells, then trophoblasts. 

But I need to check which markers are most specific. Epcam is very specific for epithelial. Claudins 6 and 7 also epithelial. Wfdc2 is pulmonary and ovarian epithelial. Mdk is more growth factor, maybe in stem cells or cancer. H19 is embryonic. Mif is immune, but other markers are not immune. So maybe the cell types are a mix. But the majority markers point to epithelial. So perhaps the top 3 are:

1. Epithelial cells (lung or ovarian)
2. Embryonic stem cells
3. Trophoblast cells

But another possibility is that the markers are indicative of a specific epithelial subtype. For example, Clara cells in the lung (since Wfdc2 is expressed there), intestinal epithelial cells (Claudins and Epcam), and maybe a cancer cell line. Alternatively, ovarian surface epithelial cells. 

Alternatively, considering that Cldn6 and Cldn7 are in tight junctions of various epithelia, and Epcam is general epithelial, then the top cell type is epithelial. Then, the presence of H19 and Mdk might suggest a stem cell type, so perhaps the next is embryonic stem cells. Then, maybe trophoblasts or a specific epithelial subtype. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell types are: 1. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2), 2. Intestinal epithelial cells (Claudins and Epcam), 3. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk). 

But I'm not sure. The strongest markers are Epcam and Claudins, which are epithelial. Wfdc2 adds to epithelial. H19 and Mdk might be in stem cells or cancer. Cdk4 is cell cycle, so proliferating cells. 

Another angle: Epcam and Claudins are often used as markers for epithelial cells. H19 is associated with pluripotency in some contexts. Mdk is expressed in neural stem cells. But combining these, maybe the cell types are:

1. Epithelial cells (Epcam, Claudins, Wfdc2)
2. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Cdk4, Mdk)
3. Neural progenitor cells (Mdk, Bex4)

But Bex4 is brain-expressed, so maybe neural. However, the presence of Epcam would suggest epithelial over neural. So perhaps the third is a neural cell type. But how likely is that? Alternatively, considering that some markers are in cancer, maybe the top three are:

1. Carcinoma cells (Epcam, Claudins, Cdk4, H19)
2. Pulmonary epithelial cells (Wfdc2)
3. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk)

But the user asks for cell types, not cancer vs normal. So likely, the answer is:

1. Epithelial cells
2. Embryonic stem cells
3. Trophoblast cells

But I need to check if H19 is specific to trophoblasts. H19 is highly expressed in placenta and embryonic tissues. So trophoblast cells might express H19. Alternatively, germ cells. 

Alternatively, considering all markers, the top three cell types could be:

1. Pulmonary epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Epcam, Claudins)
2. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Epcam)
3. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4)

But it's possible that the same cell type has multiple markers. For example, a cancer cell line with epithelial markers and embryonic genes. But the user probably wants normal cell types. 

Alternatively, combining all markers, the most likely cell types are:

1. Epithelial cells (Epcam, Cldn6, Cldn7, Wfdc2)
2. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4, Hmgn1)
3. Trophoblast cells (H19, Mdk)

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: look up each gene's typical cell markers. 

- Wfdc2: lung epithelial cells, ovarian surface epithelium.
- Mdk: expressed in various cancers, also in embryonic tissues, neural stem cells.
- H19: embryonic stem cells, placenta, some cancers.
- Mif: macrophages, T cells.
- Cldn6/7: epithelial tight junctions.
- Cdk4: proliferating cells.
- Bex4: brain-expressed, but this is Bex4, maybe neuronal progenitors.
- Hmgn1: cells with active transcription, like stem cells.
- Epcam: epithelial cells.

So, if the cell has Epcam, Cldn6/7, Wfdc2, it's epithelial. H19 and Mdk might point to embryonic stem cells or trophoblasts. However, since Epcam is epithelial, maybe the cell type is a stem cell within the epithelial lineage, like a progenitor, but that's getting too specific. Alternatively, the cell could be a mix of markers from different cell types, but the user wants the top 3 cell types. So the strongest markers are epithelial, then embryonic, then maybe trophoblast or stem cells. 

Alternatively, the presence of Mif might indicate some immune infiltration, but since it's only one marker among many epithelial, maybe it's a tumor-associated epithelial cell. But the question is about cell types, not specific conditions. 

So, likely ranking:

1. Epithelial cells (due to Epcam, Cldn6, Cldn7, Wfdc2)
2. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4, Hmgn1)
3. Trophoblast cells (H19, Mdk)

Alternatively, trophoblast might not be top 3. Maybe the third is a neural cell type due to Bex4 and Mdk. But Bex4 is not as strong a marker as others. 

Alternatively, considering Cdk4 is in proliferating cells, maybe a progenitor cell type. But I think the top 3 are:

Epithelial cells, embryonic stem cells, and trophoblast cells. However, another possibility is that the third is a cancer cell line (like carcinoma), but the user wants cell types, not cancer vs normal. 

Another angle: If this is a single cell with all these markers, which is unlikely, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types, considering each marker's association. So the most probable cell types based on the majority markers are epithelial, embryonic stem, and trophoblast. But perhaps the correct answer is:

1. Epithelial cells
2. Embryonic stem cells
3. Trophoblast cells

But maybe the user expects something else. Alternatively, considering that H19 and Mdk are also in some cancers, maybe the third is carcinoma cells, but again, cell types. 

Alternatively, the top three could be:

1. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Epcam, Cldn7)
2. Pulmonary epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Cldn6, Epcam)
3. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4)

But the problem says "mouse cells" in general. So the answer is likely the three most probable cell types based on the combination of markers. Since Epcam and Claudins are strong epithelial markers, that's first. Then, H19 and Mdk suggest embryonic stem cells. Third, maybe trophoblasts or another epithelial subtype. Alternatively, considering Cdk4 and Hmgn1, maybe a stem/progenitor cell. 

Alternatively, the top three cell types are:

1. Epithelial cells
2. Embryonic stem cells
3. Trophoblast cells

But I need to check if these markers are known in these cell types. For example, Epcam and Claudins are epithelial. H19 and Mdk are in embryonic stem cells. Trophoblasts express H19. So that fits. 

Another possibility is that the cell is a cancer cell line derived from epithelial cells with stem-like features, hence the combination of epithelial and embryonic markers. But the user just wants cell types, not cancer-specific. 

In conclusion, the top three cell types based on the markers provided are most likely:

1. Epithelial cells (due to Epcam, Cldn6, Cldn7, Wfdc2)
2. Embryonic stem cells (H19, Mdk, Cdk4, Hmgn1)
3. Trophoblast cells (H19, Mdk)

But I'm not 100% sure about the order. Alternatively, trophoblast might be third. Another thought: Bex4 is brain-expressed, but if there's not enough markers for neural, perhaps it's lower. So the answer is:

Epithelial cells, Embryonic stem cells, Trophoblast cells

Epithelial cells, Embryonic stem cells, Trophoblast cells
