Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Kap: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase A1 family of aspartic proteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate an activation peptide and the mature protease. The activation peptides of aspartic proteinases function as inhibitors of the protease active site. These peptide segments, or pro-parts, are deemed important for correct folding, targeting, and control of the activation of aspartic proteinase zymogens. The encoded protease may play a role in the proteolytic processing of pulmonary surfactant protein B in the lung and may function in protein catabolism in the renal proximal tubules. This gene has been described as a marker for lung adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]
- Miox: Enables ferric iron binding activity and inositol oxygenase activity. Involved in inositol catabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm and inclusion body. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Aldob: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a tetrameric glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase isozymes which are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. Differences indicate that aldolases A, B, and C are distinct proteins, the products of a family of related 'housekeeping' genes exhibiting developmentally regulated expression of the different isozymes. The developing embryo produces aldolase A, which is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle where it can be as much as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney and intestine, aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally. There is a high degree of homology between aldolase A and C. Defects in ALDOB cause hereditary fructose intolerance. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]
- Akr1c21: Gene ID not found
- Fxyd2: This gene encodes a member of the FXYD family of transmembrane proteins. This particular protein encodes the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gamma. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Renal Hypomagnesemia-2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. Read-through transcripts have been observed between this locus and the upstream FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 6 (FXYD6, GeneID 53826) locus.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]
- Gsta2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. These enzymes function in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding these enzymes are known to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual's susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and efficacy of some drugs. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene encodes a glutathione S-tranferase belonging to the alpha class. The alpha class genes, located in a cluster mapped to chromosome 6, are the most abundantly expressed glutathione S-transferases in liver. In addition to metabolizing bilirubin and certain anti-cancer drugs in the liver, the alpha class of these enzymes exhibit glutathione peroxidase activity thereby protecting the cells from reactive oxygen species and the products of peroxidation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gpx3: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family, members of which catalyze the reduction of organic hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by glutathione, and thereby protect cells against oxidative damage. Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme is secreted, and is abundantly found in plasma. Downregulation of expression of this gene by promoter hypermethylation has been observed in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, including thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic myeloid leukemia. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]
- Rida: Enables 2-iminobutanoate deaminase activity and mRNA binding activity. Involved in mRNA catabolic process; mRNA destabilization; and organonitrogen compound catabolic process. Located in cytoplasm and nucleus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ass1: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the penultimate step of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. There are approximately 10 to 14 copies of this gene including the pseudogenes scattered across the human genome, among which the one located on chromosome 9 appears to be the only functional gene for argininosuccinate synthetase. Mutations in the chromosome 9 copy of this gene cause citrullinemia. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]
- Keg1: Gene ID not found

<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers are Kap, Miox, Aldob, Akr1c21, Fxyd2, Gsta2, Gpx3, Rida, Ass1, and Keg1. Some of these genes have descriptions from NCBI, others like Akr1c21 and Keg1 aren't found.

First, I'll go through each marker and see what they are associated with. 

Starting with Kap. The description says it's a marker for lung adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. So maybe it's present in lung or kidney cells. Specifically, it's involved in processing pulmonary surfactant protein B in the lung and protein catabolism in renal proximal tubules. So Kap might indicate lung type II alveolar cells (which produce surfactant) or kidney proximal tubule cells.

Miox is involved in inositol catabolism and is located in cytoplasm. Inositol metabolism is important in the kidney, especially in the proximal tubule. Miox might be a marker for kidney cells, maybe proximal tubule cells.

Aldob is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase B. The description says aldolase B is produced in liver, kidney, and intestine. So Aldob is a marker for liver hepatocytes and kidney cells. Since Aldob is specific to aldolase B, which is in liver and kidney, this could point towards hepatocytes or proximal tubule cells.

Akr1c21 wasn't found, but AKR1C family members are involved in steroid metabolism. In mice, Akr1c21 might be expressed in liver or steroidogenic tissues. But since the gene ID isn't found, maybe it's a less common marker or specific to certain cell types.

Fxyd2 is part of the sodium/potassium ATPase complex. It's associated with renal hypomagnesemia, so it's likely in the kidney, specifically in the distal convoluted tubule where magnesium reabsorption occurs. Fxyd2 is a marker for kidney distal tubule cells.

Gsta2 is glutathione S-transferase alpha 2, abundant in liver. This is a strong liver marker, specifically hepatocytes.

Gpx3 is glutathione peroxidase 3, secreted into plasma. It's found in the kidney, as the kidney produces many plasma proteins. Gpx3 is produced in renal proximal tubule cells and is involved in antioxidant activity.

Rida is involved in mRNA catabolism. Not sure about specific cell type here, but mRNA degradation is a general process. Maybe highly metabolic cells?

Ass1 is argininosuccinate synthetase. It's involved in the urea cycle, which is liver-specific. So Ass1 is a marker for hepatocytes.

Keg1 isn't found, so probably not useful here.

Putting this together:

- Kap: lung (alveolar type II) and kidney proximal tubule.
- Miox: kidney proximal tubule.
- Aldob: liver and kidney.
- Fxyd2: kidney distal tubule.
- Gsta2: liver.
- Gpx3: kidney.
- Ass1: liver.

So combining these markers, the overlapping cell types would be:

1. Kidney proximal tubule cells: Kap, Miox, Aldob, Gpx3.
2. Hepatocytes (liver): Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1.
3. Kidney distal tubule cells: Fxyd2.

But need to check if other markers support these. For example, does Gsta2 only appear in liver? Yes. Kap is in lung and kidney. But since there are more kidney markers (Miox, Fxyd2, Gpx3) and liver markers (Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1), maybe the top three are kidney proximal tubule, hepatocytes, and kidney distal tubule. But also, Aldob is in both liver and kidney. However, since the question is about mouse cells, and the markers from different organs might suggest multiple cell types. However, the presence of both liver and kidney markers could mean the cells are from those organs. But if there's a cell type that expresses multiple of these markers, maybe the top ones would be:

1. Kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (since Kap, Miox, Aldob, Gpx3 are all here)
2. Hepatocytes (Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1)
3. Kidney distal tubule (Fxyd2)

Alternatively, maybe the order based on the number of markers. Kidney proximal tubule has more markers (4), liver has 3, kidney distal has 1. So the top three would be Kidney Proximal Tubule Cells, Hepatocytes, Kidney Distal Tubule Cells. But wait, some sources might have other cell types. For example, Aldob (aldolase B) is specific to liver, kidney, and intestine. But with Gsta2 (liver), Ass1 (liver), so hepatocytes. The presence of Ass1 is a strong liver marker. Similarly, Fxyd2 is a strong distal tubule marker. Kap is in lung and kidney. But maybe the combination of Kap and Miox (both in kidney) would point more towards kidney. So the top three would be:

1. Kidney Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Kidney Distal Tubule Epithelial Cells

Alternatively, if the markers are from a single organ, but the presence of both liver and kidney markers might suggest different cell types. But the question is about the most likely cell types, so maybe the answer is:

Proximal Tubule Cells (Kidney), Hepatocytes, Distal Tubule Cells (Kidney). But maybe alveolar type II cells (lung) could be a candidate due to Kap. But since other markers (Miox, Aldob, Fxyd2) are more kidney-related, and Gsta2 and Ass1 are liver, the top three would be those three. Alternatively, if the presence of Kap in lung adenocarcinoma is considered, but if the cell type is normal, then Kap in proximal tubule. So likely, the top three cell types are:

1. Kidney Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Kidney Distal Tubule Epithelial Cells

Another thought: Gpx3 is expressed in kidney proximal tubule. So combining Kap (proximal tubule), Miox (proximal tubule), Aldob (proximal tubule and liver), Gpx3 (proximal tubule). So that's four markers for proximal tubule. Hepatocytes with Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1. Distal tubule with Fxyd2. So the order would be proximal tubule first, hepatocytes second, distal tubule third. So the answer should be: Kidney Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells, Hepatocytes, Kidney Distal Tubule Epithelial Cells.
