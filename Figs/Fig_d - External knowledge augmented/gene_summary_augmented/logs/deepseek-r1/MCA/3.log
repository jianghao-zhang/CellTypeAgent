Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Rtn1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene is considered to be a specific marker for neurological diseases and cancer, and is a potential molecular target for therapy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]
- Nnat: The protein encoded by this gene is a proteolipid that may be involved in the regulation of ion channels during brain development. The encoded protein may also play a role in forming and maintaining the structure of the nervous system. This gene is found within an intron of another gene, bladder cancer associated protein, but on the opposite strand. This gene is imprinted and is expressed only from the paternal allele. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]
- Tubb3: This gene encodes a class III member of the beta tubulin protein family. Beta tubulins are one of two core protein families (alpha and beta tubulins) that heterodimerize and assemble to form microtubules. This protein is primarily expressed in neurons and may be involved in neurogenesis and axon guidance and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the cause of congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 6. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2010]
- Tubb2b: The protein encoded by this gene is a beta isoform of tubulin, which binds GTP and is a major component of microtubules. This gene is highly similar to TUBB2A and TUBB2C. Defects in this gene are a cause of asymmetric polymicrogyria. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]
- Tuba1a: Microtubules of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton perform essential and diverse functions and are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta tubulins. The genes encoding these microtubule constituents belong to the tubulin superfamily, which is composed of six distinct families. Genes from the alpha, beta and gamma tubulin families are found in all eukaryotes. The alpha and beta tubulins represent the major components of microtubules, while gamma tubulin plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly. There are multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes, which are highly conserved among species. This gene encodes alpha tubulin and is highly similar to the mouse and rat Tuba1 genes. Northern blot studies have shown that the gene expression is predominantly found in morphologically differentiated neurologic cells. This gene is one of three alpha-tubulin genes in a cluster on chromosome 12q. Mutations in this gene cause lissencephaly type 3 (LIS3) - a neurological condition characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early-onset epilepsy caused by defective neuronal migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]
- Stmn2: This gene encodes a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins. Stathmin proteins function in microtubule dynamics and signal transduction. The encoded protein plays a regulatory role in neuronal growth and is also thought to be involved in osteogenesis. Reductions in the expression of this gene have been associated with Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]
- Stmn3: This gene encodes a protein which is a member of the stathmin protein family. Members of this protein family form a complex with tubulins at a ratio of 2 tubulins for each stathmin protein. Microtubules require the ordered assembly of alpha- and beta-tubulins, and formation of a complex with stathmin disrupts microtubule formation and function. A pseudogene of this gene is located on chromosome 22. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2013]
- Igfbpl1: Predicted to enable insulin-like growth factor binding activity. Involved in cellular response to tumor cell. Located in extracellular space. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Tagln3: Predicted to be involved in central nervous system development. Predicted to act upstream of or within negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Predicted to be located in nucleus. Predicted to be active in cytoskeleton. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Gap43: The protein encoded by this gene has been termed a 'growth' or 'plasticity' protein because it is expressed at high levels in neuronal growth cones during development and axonal regeneration. This protein is considered a crucial component of an effective regenerative response in the nervous system. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the top 3 cell types for these mouse markers. So, the markers given are Rtn1, Nnat, Tubb3, Tubb2b, Tuba1a, Stmn2, Stmn3, Igfbpl1, Tagln3, and Gap43.

First, I need to recall what each of these genes are associated with. Let's go through them one by one.

Rtn1: The summary says it's a marker for neurological diseases and cancer, involved in neuroendocrine secretion. So this might be a neuron or some neuroendocrine cell marker.

Nnat: Expressed in the brain, involved in ion channel regulation during brain development. Imprinted and paternal allele expressed. Suggests neural or brain-related cells.

Tubb3: Class III beta tubulin, expressed in neurons, involved in neurogenesis and axon guidance. Definitely a neuronal marker. Mutations cause eye muscle issues.

Tubb2b: Another beta tubulin isoform. Defects cause polymicrogyria, which is a brain malformation. So also neuronal.

Tuba1a: Alpha tubulin, found in differentiated neurologic cells. Mutations cause lissencephaly, a brain development disorder. So neurons again.

Stmn2: Stathmin family, microtubule dynamics, neuronal growth. Reduced in Alzheimer's and Down's. Neuronal.

Stmn3: Similar to Stmn2, part of the stathmin family, involved in microtubule disruption. Also likely neuronal.

Igfbpl1: Insulin-like growth factor binding. Involved in response to tumor cells. Extracellular. Not sure about this one. Maybe some growth-related cells, but maybe not specific.

Tagln3: Involved in CNS development, nucleus and cytoskeleton. So again, central nervous system, neurons or glia?

Gap43: Growth protein, high in neuronal growth cones during development and regeneration. Crucial for nerve regeneration. Definitely a neuronal marker.

So, looking at all these markers, most of them are strongly associated with neurons. Rtn1, Nnat, Tubb3, Tubb2b, Tuba1a, Stmn2, Stmn3, Gap43 are all neuronal. Igfbpl1 and Tagln3 might be a bit less specific but still possibly related. Given that, the cell types are likely neurons. But are there different types of neurons or other neural cells?

Wait, Tubb3 is class III beta tubulin, often used as a marker for neurons. Tubb2b and Tuba1a are also neuronal tubulins. Stmn2 and Stmn3 are involved in microtubule dynamics in neurons. Gap43 is growth associated, so maybe developing neurons or regenerating neurons. Nnat is brain development. Rtn1 is neuroendocrine. So maybe neuroendocrine cells, but that's a subset of neurons.

Alternatively, could these be neural stem cells? But Gap43 is more about axonal growth, so maybe mature neurons. Alternatively, maybe specific subtypes like cortical neurons, motor neurons, or sensory neurons.

Wait, but the question is about mouse cell types. Common neural cell types are neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia. But given the markers here, almost all are neuronal. So the top 3 would be neurons, but maybe subtypes. However, the task is to list the top 3 cell types. So maybe:

1. Neurons (since most markers are neuronal)
2. Neuroendocrine cells (since Rtn1 is mentioned as specific for neuroendocrine secretion)
3. Neural progenitor cells? But not sure. Alternatively, maybe glial cells? Wait, but the markers don't point to astrocytes (like GFAP) or oligodendrocytes (like Olig2). So perhaps the next could be something else. Alternatively, maybe specific neuronal subtypes like cortical neurons, but maybe the answer is more general.

Alternatively, the presence of Gap43 might indicate developing or regenerating neurons. So maybe ranking them as:

1. Neurons (mature)
2. Developing neurons (due to Gap43, Tubb3, etc.)
3. Neuroendocrine cells (due to Rtn1)

Alternatively, maybe neuroblastoma cells, since some markers are associated with cancer (Rtn1), but the question is about normal mouse cell types.

Alternatively, considering that some genes are involved in neural development, maybe neural stem/progenitor cells. But I'm not sure if these markers are specific for progenitors. Tubb3 is more in differentiated neurons.

Wait, Stmn2 and Stmn3 are involved in microtubule dynamics, which is important in neuronal plasticity and growth. So maybe neurons, but perhaps different types.

Alternatively, maybe the top three are all neurons, but different categories. But the question says cell types, so likely different cell types. However, given that all markers are neuronal, perhaps the answer is neurons, but that's only one. Maybe the user expects other cell types where these markers are present. Wait, maybe some of these markers are also found in other cell types. For example, Tubb3 is a neuronal-specific beta-tubulin. Tuba1a is in neurons. Stmn2 is neuron-enriched. Gap43 is neuronal. So if all are neurons, then perhaps the answer is neurons as the first, but need two more. However, the problem states "mouse cells" in general, so other cell types. Are there any markers here that could indicate other cell types?

Igfbpl1: insulin-like growth factor binding, involved in response to tumor cells. Extracellular. Maybe some stromal cells or other cell types. But I'm not sure. Tagln3 is involved in CNS development, nucleus, and cytoskeleton. Maybe glial cells? But not specific markers like GFAP for astrocytes or MBP for oligodendrocytes.

Alternatively, maybe some of these markers are found in cancer cells (Rtn1 is mentioned as a cancer marker). But the question is about normal cell types.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is three different neuronal subtypes. But I think the expected answer is more likely to be neurons (as the primary), then perhaps neuroendocrine cells (since Rtn1 is mentioned there), and maybe neural progenitor cells. Alternatively, maybe astrocytes if some markers cross-react, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, looking up common cell type markers:

- Neurons: Tubb3 (Tuj1), Gap43, Stmn2, Tuba1a
- Neuroendocrine cells: Rtn1, maybe others
- Neural stem cells: Not sure if these markers are present.

Alternatively, maybe the third is oligodendrocyte precursor cells? But I don't think these markers are typical for that.

Alternatively, looking at the combination, maybe the cell types are:

1. Neurons
2. Neural progenitor cells (but again, not sure)
3. Neuroendocrine cells

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

1. Neurons
2. Neuroendocrine cells
3. Neural stem cells

But I need to check if these markers are indeed found in those types.

Alternatively, another approach: look up each gene's expression in cell types.

Rtn1: neuroendocrine cells, neurons.

Nnat: brain, neurons.

Tubb3: neurons.

Tubb2b: neurons.

Tuba1a: neurons.

Stmn2: neurons.

Stmn3: neurons.

Igfbpl1: not sure, maybe other tissues.

Tagln3: CNS development, neurons.

Gap43: neurons.

So, almost all are neuronal. Maybe the top three are all neuronal subtypes, but the question might expect broader cell types. However, the user might want the main cell type (neurons) and then perhaps the next possible, but since all are neuronal, perhaps the answer is neurons, but the user might expect other cell types. Wait, perhaps some of these markers are also found in other cell types. For example, Tubb3 is a classic neuronal marker (beta-III tubulin), but sometimes used in other cells? But generally, TUBB3 is specific to neurons. Similarly, Gap43 is neuronal.

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a specific type of neuron, such as cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, etc., but the question probably expects general cell types.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and some other neural cell type, but given that most markers are neuronal, perhaps the answer is three types of neurons. But the problem states "cell types", which usually refers to broader categories (like neuron, astrocyte, etc.).

But given that all markers are neuronal, the answer might just be neurons, but the user wants top 3. Maybe the user expects that even if all are neuronal, list three types. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the markers are indicative of different neuronal maturation stages. For example, Gap43 is associated with developing neurons, Tubb3 with mature neurons. So perhaps:

1. Mature neurons
2. Developing neurons
3. Neuroendocrine cells

But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of Igfbpl1 and Tagln3 suggests other cell types. For example, Igfbpl1 is involved in insulin-like growth factor binding, which could be relevant in liver or other tissues, but the other markers are overwhelmingly neuronal. So maybe the primary cell type is neurons, and the other two are less likely but possible. But I think the correct answer here is that all markers point to neurons, so the top three cell types would be neurons, but since the user wants three, perhaps they expect neuroendocrine cells and another type. Alternatively, maybe the answer is neurons, neural stem cells, and neuroendocrine cells. But I need to check if any of the markers are known for stem cells.

Nnat is expressed in brain development, maybe in neural stem cells. Tubb3 is in differentiated neurons. So neural stem cells might not express Tubb3. So maybe:

1. Neurons
2. Neuroendocrine cells
3. Neural progenitor cells (but conflicting markers)

Alternatively, since Rtn1 is associated with neuroendocrine cells, which are a type of cell found in various organs, like the pancreas (islets) or adrenal medulla. So maybe neuroendocrine cells are a separate cell type.

But given that most markers are neuronal, the top cell type is neurons, then neuroendocrine, then perhaps another neuronal subtype. However, the user might expect the answer to be three different cell types even if the markers are mostly neuronal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

1. Neurons
2. Neuroendocrine cells
3. Neural crest cells

But I don't know if these markers are in neural crest.

Alternatively, maybe the third is glial cells, but I don't see glial markers here. Stmn2 is neuronal.

Given the information, I think the safest answer is that the top three cell types are all neuronal-related, with the first being neurons, second neuroendocrine cells, and third maybe neural progenitor cells. But I'm not entirely confident. However, given the markers provided, the majority are neuronal, so the top three are likely:

Neurons, Neuroendocrine cells, and possibly Neural stem/progenitor cells. But I need to check if any of the markers are known for progenitor cells.

Gap43 is expressed in developing neurons, so maybe during development. Nnat is involved in brain development. Tubb3 is in differentiated neurons. So maybe:

1. Mature neurons
2. Developing neurons
3. Neuroendocrine cells

Alternatively, the user may just expect three different types of neurons. But the question is about cell types, not subtypes.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is neurons, then two other non-neuronal cell types that might express some of these markers. For example, Rtn1 is in neuroendocrine cells (which can be in various tissues), Igfbpl1 might be in other cell types. But given the majority of markers are neuronal, the primary would be neurons.

Alternatively, perhaps cancer cells, since Rtn1 is mentioned as a cancer marker, but the question is about normal mouse cells.

I think the most logical answer is:

1. Neurons

2. Neuroendocrine cells

3. Neural progenitor cells

But I'm not sure about the third. Another possibility is that since there are multiple tubulin genes (Tubb3, Tubb2b, Tuba1a), which are markers for neurons, but also perhaps for rapidly dividing cells, but neurons are post-mitotic. Alternatively, maybe the third is a glial cell type, but no glial markers are present.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is just three different neuronal subtypes, but the question likely wants broader cell types.

Given the information, I think the top three are neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and possibly neural stem cells, but I'm not certain. However, given that almost all markers are neuronal, the answer is likely:

Neurons, Neuroendocrine cells, and a third which is maybe a subtype, but since the user wants three, perhaps the third is a glial cell, but there's no evidence here. Alternatively, maybe the third is a cancer cell, but the context is normal.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a sensory neuron or motor neuron, but again, these are subtypes.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

Neurons, Neuroendocrine cells, and Neural stem cells.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, given that Tubb3, Tubb2b, Tuba1a are all tubulins expressed in neurons, Stmn2, Stmn3, Gap43 are neuronal, Nnat is brain-specific, Rtn1 is neuroendocrine. So the top three cell types are:

1. Neurons

2. Neuroendocrine cells

3. ?

Maybe the third is neural crest-derived cells, but unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the third is adrenal medullary cells (which are neuroendocrine), but that's a subset.

Alternatively, maybe the third is enteric neurons, but again subset.

Hmm. Given the markers, the top two are neurons and neuroendocrine. For the third, maybe the user expects astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, but there's no markers for those here. So perhaps the third is another neuronal type, but since the question asks for cell types, maybe the answer is neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and another cell type that expresses some of the remaining markers. But I can't think of one. Igfbpl1 is involved in insulin-like growth factor binding, which could be in liver, muscle, etc., but given the other markers are neuronal, maybe not. Tagln3 is CNS development. Maybe glial cells, but no.

Alternatively, maybe the third is a cancer cell line, but the question is about normal cells.

Given the uncertainty, but based on the markers provided, the most likely top three cell types are:

1. Neurons

2. Neuroendocrine cells

3. Neural progenitor cells

But I'm not entirely sure about the third. Alternatively, maybe the answer is three types of neurons, but the question expects distinct cell types. Alternatively, since Rtn1 is linked to neuroendocrine, and others to neurons, maybe the third is a cell type from the central nervous system, but that's vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply neurons listed three times, but that doesn't make sense. The user probably wants three different cell types.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is:

1. Neurons

2. Neuroendocrine cells

3. Neural stem cells

But I'm not certain. I'll go with that.
