Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Inha: This gene encodes a member of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate multiple peptide products, including the alpha subunit of the inhibin A and B protein complexes. These complexes negatively regulate follicle stimulating hormone secretion from the pituitary gland. Inhibins have also been implicated in regulating numerous cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune response and hormone secretion. Mutations in this gene may be associated with male infertility and premature ovarian failure in female human patients. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]
- Akr1cl: Gene ID not found
- Hsd3b1: The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta-5-3-beta-hydroxysteroid precursors into delta-4-ketosteroids, which leads to the production of all classes of steroid hormones. The encoded protein also catalyzes the interconversion of 3-beta-hydroxy- and 3-keto-5-alpha-androstane steroids. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2016]
- Serpine2: This gene encodes a member of the serpin family of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. Thrombin, urokinase, plasmin and trypsin are among the proteases that this family member can inhibit. This gene is a susceptibility gene for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for emphysema. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]
- Bex4: This gene is a member of the brain expressed X-linked gene family. The proteins encoded by some of the other members of this family act as transcription elongation factors which allow RNA polymerase II to escape pausing during elongation. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Nap1l5: This gene encodes a protein that shares sequence similarity to nucleosome assembly factors, but may be localized to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Expression of this gene is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas. This gene is located within a differentially methylated region (DMR) and is imprinted and paternally expressed. There is a related pseudogene on chromosome 4. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Ctsl: The protein encoded by this gene is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that plays a major role in intracellular protein catabolism. Its substrates include collagen and elastin, as well as alpha-1 protease inhibitor, a major controlling element of neutrophil elastase activity. The encoded protein has been implicated in several pathologic processes, including myofibril necrosis in myopathies and in myocardial ischemia, and in the renal tubular response to proteinuria. This protein, which is a member of the peptidase C1 family, is a dimer composed of disulfide-linked heavy and light chains, both produced from a single protein precursor. Additionally, this protein cleaves the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is necessary for entry of the virus into the cell. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]
- Htra1: This gene encodes a member of the trypsin family of serine proteases. This protein is a secreted enzyme that is proposed to regulate the availability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) by cleaving IGF-binding proteins. It has also been suggested to be a regulator of cell growth. Variations in the promoter region of this gene are the cause of susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration type 7. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tnni3: Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. This gene encodes the TnI-cardiac protein and is exclusively expressed in cardiac muscle tissues. Mutations in this gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy type 7 (CMH7) and familial restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Troponin I is useful in making a diagnosis of heart failure, and of ischemic heart disease. An elevated level of troponin is also now used as indicator of acute myocardial injury in patients hospitalized with moderate/severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Such elevation has also been associated with higher risk of mortality in cardiovascular disease patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]
- Hsd17b1: This gene encodes a member of the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. It has a dual function in estrogen activation and androgen inactivation and plays a major role in establishing the estrogen E2 concentration gradient between serum and peripheral tissues. The encoded protein catalyzes the last step in estrogen activation, using NADPH to convert estrogens E1 and E2 and androgens like 4-androstenedione, to testosterone. It has an N-terminal short-chain dehydrogenase domain with a cofactor binding site, and a narrow, hydrophobic C-terminal domain with a steroid substrate binding site. This gene is expressed primarily in the placenta and ovarian granulosa cells, and to a lesser extent, in the endometrium, adipose tissue, and prostate. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to breast and prostate cancer. A pseudogene of this gene has been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these mouse markers. So the markers given are Inha, Akr1cl (which wasn't found), Hsd3b1, Serpine2, Bex4, Nap1l5, Ctsl, Htra1, Tnni3, and Hsd17b1. First, I need to recall what each of these genes does and in which cell types they're typically expressed.

Starting with Inha: The summary says it's part of the TGF-beta superfamily and involved in inhibin A and B, which regulate follicle-stimulating hormone. So maybe related to ovarian or testicular cells, like granulosa cells in ovaries or Sertoli cells in testes. Inhibins are definitely involved in reproductive tissues.

Hsd3b1: This enzyme is involved in steroid hormone synthesis. It converts precursors into active steroids, so cells that produce steroids. That would include adrenal cortex cells (like zona glomerulosa, fasciculata, reticularis), or gonadal cells like Leydig cells in testes (testosterone) or theca cells in ovaries (androstenedione).

Hsd17b1: Another enzyme in steroidogenesis, specifically involved in converting estrone to estradiol. This is important in ovarian granulosa cells, which produce estrogens. Also might be in placenta or other steroidogenic tissues.

Ctsl: Cathepsin L, a lysosomal protease. Expressed in many cells, but high in macrophages, epithelial cells, maybe placental cells. Also mentioned in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but that's more about viral entry in lung cells, but maybe other epithelial cells.

Tnni3: Cardiac troponin I, specific to cardiac muscle cells. So definitely a marker for cardiomyocytes. If this gene is present, it's a strong indicator of cardiac muscle cells.

Serpine2: Serine protease inhibitor, involved in inhibiting proteases like thrombin, plasmin. Expressed in neurons, maybe some epithelial cells, or in tissues where extracellular matrix remodeling is important. Could be in Sertoli cells or other supportive cells.

Htra1: Serine protease involved in IGF binding proteins. Associated with macular degeneration, but also expressed in various tissues. Maybe in retinal cells, but also in certain epithelial or mesenchymal cells.

Bex4: Part of a brain-expressed X-linked family. Might be in neurons or neural progenitor cells. However, the description says it's involved in transcription elongation, so maybe active in cells with high transcriptional activity, but not sure.

Nap1l5: Imprinted gene, paternally expressed, involved in nucleosome assembly. Downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Maybe in liver cells, or stem cells? Not too clear.

Putting this together: Tnni3 is a clear marker for cardiomyocytes. Hsd3b1 and Hsd17b1 are both involved in steroidogenesis. Hsd3b1 is critical in adrenal and gonadal steroid-producing cells. Hsd17b1 is more specific to estrogen production, so granulosa cells. Inha is linked to inhibin, which is produced by ovarian granulosa cells and testicular Sertoli cells. Ctsl might be in macrophages or epithelial cells. Serpine2 could be in neurons or other secretory cells.

So possible cell types:

1. Granulosa cells (Inha, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b1)
2. Leydig cells (Hsd3b1, maybe Hsd17b1)
3. Cardiomyocytes (Tnni3)

But wait, Tnni3 is only in cardiomyocytes. However, the other markers (Inha, Hsd3b1, etc.) are not typical for heart cells. So maybe the presence of Tnni3 indicates a cardiac cell, but the other markers suggest steroidogenic cells. However, if a cell has both Tnni3 and steroidogenic enzymes, that might be conflicting. Unless it's a mixed population or some other cell type. But likely, the presence of Tnni3 is a strong indicator for cardiomyocytes. So perhaps the top three are:

1. Granulosa cells (Inha, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b1)
2. Leydig cells (Hsd3b1, Hsd17b1)
3. Cardiomyocytes (Tnni3)

Alternatively, considering Inha is also in Sertoli cells. But Sertoli cells would have Inha, maybe not the Hsd enzymes. Leydig cells have Hsd3b1 and Hsd17b1. Granulosa cells have Inha, Hsd3b1, and Hsd17b1. So maybe granulosa cells are top. Then Leydig. Then cardiomyocytes. Serpine2 might be in other cells, but not sure. Ctsl could be in macrophages, but maybe also in granulosa cells? Not certain. Another thought: The presence of multiple steroidogenic enzymes (Hsd3b1, Hsd17b1) plus Inha points towards ovarian granulosa cells. Then Leydig cells would have Hsd3b1 but maybe not Hsd17b1? Or do Leydig cells express Hsd17b1? Hmm. Hsd17b1 is more involved in estrogen synthesis, which in males is less prominent. Leydig cells mainly produce testosterone. Hsd3b1 is involved in testosterone synthesis. So maybe Hsd17b1 is more in granulosa cells. Therefore, combining Inha (granulosa), Hsd3b1 (steroidogenic cells), Hsd17b1 (granulosa), that's granulosa cells. Then Leydig would have Hsd3b1 but not Inha or Hsd17b1. So the top three cell types are likely:

1. Ovarian granulosa cells
2. Testicular Leydig cells
3. Cardiomyocytes

Alternatively, another possibility: Adrenal cortical cells (zona reticularis/fasciculata) also express Hsd3b1. But they don't express Inha. So if Inha is present, it's more likely gonadal.

So the top three cell types would be:

1. Ovarian granulosa cells
2. Testicular Leydig cells
3. Cardiomyocytes

But I need to check if any other markers support this. For example, Serpine2: if it's expressed in granulosa cells. Serpine2 (protease inhibitor) might be involved in ovarian follicle development. Ctsl: maybe in granulosa cells for tissue remodeling. Htra1: not sure. Bex4: brain expressed, but maybe in germ cells? Not sure. Nap1l5: imprinted, maybe in germ cells or placental cells. But the strongest markers are Inha, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b1 for granulosa cells; Hsd3b1 and maybe others for Leydig; Tnni3 for cardiomyocytes. So the answer is likely Granulosa cells, Leydig cells, Cardiomyocytes.
