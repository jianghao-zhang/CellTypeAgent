Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Plp1: This gene encodes a transmembrane proteolipid protein that is the predominant component of myelin. The encoded protein may play a role in the compaction, stabilization, and maintenance of myelin sheaths, as well as in oligodendrocyte development and axonal survival. Mutations in this gene cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type 2. Alternatively splicing results in multiple transcript variants, including the DM20 splice variant. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015]
- Ptgds: The protein encoded by this gene is a glutathione-independent prostaglandin D synthase that catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to postaglandin D2 (PGD2). PGD2 functions as a neuromodulator as well as a trophic factor in the central nervous system. PGD2 is also involved in smooth muscle contraction/relaxation and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. This gene is preferentially expressed in brain. Studies with transgenic mice overexpressing this gene suggest that this gene may be also involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement sleep. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Mbp: This gene encodes the soluble mannose-binding lectin or mannose-binding protein found in serum. The protein encoded belongs to the collectin family and is an important element in the innate immune system. The protein recognizes and binds to mannose and N-acetylglucosamine on many microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, and viruses including influenza virus, HIV and SARS-CoV. This binding activates the classical complement pathway. Deficiencies of this gene have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]
- Cldn11: This gene encodes a member of the claudin family. Claudins are integral membrane proteins and components of tight junction strands. Tight junction strands serve as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space between epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, and also play critical roles in maintaining cell polarity and signal transductions. The protein encoded by this gene is a major component of central nervous system (CNS) myelin and plays an important role in regulating proliferation and migration of oligodendrocytes. Mouse studies showed that the gene deficiency results in deafness and loss of the Sertoli cell epithelial phenotype in the testis. This protein is a tight junction protein at the human blood-testis barrier (BTB), and the BTB disruption is related to a dysfunction of this gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
- Aplp1: This gene encodes a member of the highly conserved amyloid precursor protein gene family. The encoded protein is a membrane-associated glycoprotein that is cleaved by secretases in a manner similar to amyloid beta A4 precursor protein cleavage. This cleavage liberates an intracellular cytoplasmic fragment that may act as a transcriptional activator. The encoded protein may also play a role in synaptic maturation during cortical development. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ermn: Predicted to enable actin filament binding activity. Involved in actin filament organization; regulation of cell projection organization; and regulation of cell shape. Located in cell cortex; internode region of axon; and paranode region of axon. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Mobp: Predicted to enable actin binding activity and myosin binding activity. Predicted to be a structural constituent of myelin sheath. Predicted to be involved in nervous system development. Predicted to be located in mitochondrion. Predicted to be active in cortical actin cytoskeleton. Implicated in frontotemporal dementia. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Apod: This gene encodes a component of high density lipoprotein that has no marked similarity to other apolipoprotein sequences. It has a high degree of homology to plasma retinol-binding protein and other members of the alpha 2 microglobulin protein superfamily of carrier proteins, also known as lipocalins. This glycoprotein is closely associated with the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase - an enzyme involved in lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]
- Mag: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane protein and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is thought to be involved in the process of myelination. It is a lectin that binds to sialylated glycoconjugates and mediates certain myelin-neuron cell-cell interactions. Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]
- Stmn4: Predicted to enable tubulin binding activity. Predicted to be involved in microtubule depolymerization; neuron projection development; and regulation of microtubule polymerization or depolymerization. Predicted to be located in Golgi apparatus and growth cone. Predicted to be active in cytoplasm and neuron projection. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's see. I need to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on these markers: Plp1, Ptgds, Mbp, Cldn11, Aplp1, Ermn, Mobp, Apod, Mag, Stmn4.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall which cell types they're associated with. 

Starting with Plp1. From the summary, Plp1 is a proteolipid protein predominant in myelin, involved in oligodendrocyte development. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for myelination in the central nervous system. So Plp1 is a marker for oligodendrocytes.

Ptgds is a prostaglandin D synthase, expressed in the brain. It's involved in neuromodulation and sleep regulation. Ptgds is known to be expressed in oligodendrocytes and possibly in some neurons, but I think it's also found in leptomeningeal cells, but maybe more specific to oligodendrocyte lineage.

Mbp (Myelin Basic Protein) is another key component of myelin, definitely an oligodendrocyte marker in the CNS. So that's another point for oligodendrocytes.

Cldn11 (Claudin 11) is involved in tight junctions in myelin, specifically in the central nervous system. It's crucial for proper myelination and is expressed by oligodendrocytes. So another oligodendrocyte marker.

Aplp1 (Amyloid-like protein 1) is part of the amyloid precursor family. It's involved in synaptic maturation. This might be more neuronal, but some studies show it's also in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Not sure yet.

Ermn (Ermin) is involved in actin filament organization in oligodendrocytes, necessary for myelin sheath formation. So definitely an oligodendrocyte marker.

Mobp (Myelin-associated Oligodendrocyte Basic Protein) is a structural component of myelin. As the name suggests, oligodendrocytes again.

Apod (Apolipoprotein D) is part of HDL and associated with lipid metabolism. It's expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, in some contexts, it's more astrocyte-related, but maybe also in oligodendrocytes.

Mag (Myelin-associated Glycoprotein) is a myelin protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells (which are in the PNS), but since these are mouse cells, and considering other markers, more likely oligodendrocytes here.

Stmn4 (Stathmin 4) is involved in microtubule dynamics, found in neurons, particularly in axon growth and regeneration. So this might suggest some neuronal component, but maybe also in oligodendrocyte precursors during development.

Now, compiling all these: most markers point to oligodendrocytes. Plp1, Mbp, Cldn11, Ermn, Mobp, Mag are all strong oligodendrocyte markers. Apod might be in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Ptgds could be in oligodendrocytes or other brain cells. Stmn4 maybe in neurons or developing oligodendrocytes.

But given the majority, the primary cell type here is definitely oligodendrocytes. However, the question is about top 3 cell types. So maybe there's a mix. Wait, but all the markers except maybe Stmn4 and Apod are oligodendrocyte-specific. So perhaps the other cell types are astrocytes and neurons? Let me check.

Wait, Apod is in astrocytes. If Apod is present, maybe astrocytes are the second. But other markers like Ptgds might be in astrocytes? Let me recall: Ptgds is prostaglandin D synthase, which in the brain is primarily in leptomeningeal cells, but also in oligodendrocytes. Alternatively, maybe microglia or astrocytes. But if most markers are oligodendrocyte, then perhaps the second is astrocytes (Apod), and third maybe Schwann cells? But Schwann cells are PNS, and these markers like Plp1 and Mbp are in CNS. Alternatively, maybe neurons because of Stmn4. But Stmn4 is in neurons, but if the majority are oligodendrocyte markers, maybe the other cell types are less likely. Alternatively, maybe oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a possibility. But OPCs might express different markers like Pdgfra. 

Alternatively, maybe microglia? But none of the markers here are typical microglia markers (like Aif1/Iba1). 

Wait, Apod is also expressed in oligodendrocytes. So if Apod is present here, perhaps it's still oligodendrocytes. Then maybe the top three are all oligodendrocyte-related? But the question asks for different cell types. 

Alternatively, perhaps the markers are from a mixture, but the majority are oligodendrocyte. Then the next could be astrocytes (Apod), and then maybe neurons (Stmn4). But how strong is Apod as an astrocyte marker? Maybe it's more associated with oligodendrocytes in some contexts. 

Alternatively, looking at the markers again: Plp1, Mbp, Mag, Cldn11, Ermn, Mobp are all myelin-related and oligodendrocyte-specific. Ptgds is also in oligodendrocytes. Aplp1 is in neurons and maybe oligodendrocytes. Apod might be in astrocytes but also oligodendrocytes. Stmn4 is in neurons. 

So, the primary cell type is oligodendrocyte. Then, maybe neurons (due to Stmn4 and Aplp1) as second. But I need to see if there are enough markers for another cell type. For example, if most markers are oligodendrocyte, then the other cell types might be astrocytes and neurons. But Astrocytes would have markers like Gfap, which is not listed here. Apod is sometimes in astrocytes, but not a definitive marker. Alternatively, maybe Schwann cells, but they are PNS. 

Alternatively, the presence of Stmn4 and Aplp1 might indicate neuronal involvement. But given the dominance of oligodendrocyte markers, maybe the top three are all subsets of oligodendrocytes? But the question probably expects different cell types. 

Alternatively, perhaps the cell type is a mixture of oligodendrocytes, followed by Schwann cells (but those are PNS, and these markers are CNS), so that's unlikely. 

Wait, another possibility: Oligodendrocytes, then maybe myelinating Schwann cells (but Mag is present in both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells). But again, since the other markers are CNS-specific, like Plp1 and Cldn11, which are in CNS myelin. Therefore, Schwann cells are less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the second cell type is astrocytes (Apod, Ptgds?), but not sure. Ptgds is more in oligodendrocytes. 

Alternatively, maybe the top three are all oligodendrocyte-related, but different stages. For example, mature oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and perhaps another glial cell. But OPCs usually express different markers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Aplp1 and Stmn4 indicates some neuronal contamination, but given the majority markers, the top three would be:

1. Oligodendrocytes (most markers)
2. Astrocytes (Apod)
3. Neurons (Stmn4, Aplp1)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe microglia, but no markers here. 

Alternatively, since Ptgds is also expressed in leptomeningeal cells, which are part of the meninges, but that's a less common cell type. 

Alternatively, looking up some references: 

Plp1, Mbp, Mag, Cldn11, Mobp, Ermn are all classic oligodendrocyte markers. 

Apod is found in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. 

Aplp1 is in neurons and oligodendrocytes. 

Stmn4 is neuronal. 

Ptgds can be in oligodendrocytes or other cells. 

So if the majority are oligodendrocyte markers, the primary cell type is oligodendrocyte. Then, the next might be astrocytes (Apod), but only one marker. Then neurons (Stmn4, Aplp1). Alternatively, if the markers are all from one cell type, but maybe the data is from a population with some contamination. However, the question is to list the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided. 

Given the markers, the strongest is oligodendrocytes. Then, perhaps the presence of Apod suggests astrocytes. But maybe the second is neurons due to Stmn4 and Aplp1. But Apod is more associated with astrocytes. 

Alternatively, another approach: check each gene's cell type specificity. 

Plp1: Oligodendrocytes
Ptgds: Oligodendrocytes, maybe some neurons
Mbp: Oligodendrocytes
Cldn11: Oligodendrocytes
Aplp1: Neurons, maybe oligodendrocytes
Ermn: Oligodendrocytes
Mobp: Oligodendrocytes
Apod: Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
Mag: Oligodendrocytes (CNS), Schwann cells (PNS)
Stmn4: Neurons

So majority (Plp1, Mbp, Cldn11, Ermn, Mobp, Mag) are oligodendrocyte. 

Then, Stmn4 and Aplp1 point to neurons. Apod could be astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. 

So the top cell type is Oligodendrocytes. Then, the next would be Neurons (Stmn4, Aplp1). Third, Astrocytes (Apod). 

Alternatively, if Apod is considered more for oligodendrocytes here, then maybe Neurons as second, and Schwann cells third (Mag is also in Schwann cells). But in CNS context, Schwann cells are not present. So probably not. 

Alternatively, since Mag is in oligodendrocytes (CNS), so Schwann cells are PNS, so less likely. So the third could be Astrocytes. 

So the top three would be:

1. Oligodendrocytes
2. Neurons
3. Astrocytes

But I need to check if there are any other markers. For example, Ptgds is in oligodendrocytes, so perhaps neurons are second. But Ptgds might be more in oligodendrocytes. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a mixture of oligodendrocytes, and the other markers are from the same cell type. For example, oligodendrocytes express all these markers, and Stmn4 might be in some subsets. But I think Stmn4 is more neuronal. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is an oligodendrocyte, and the other genes are part of its function. But Apod and Stmn4 are not typically in oligodendrocytes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the cell type is oligodendrocyte, then the next is a type of neuron, then maybe a glial cell like astrocyte. 

So based on the markers, the most likely top three:

1. Oligodendrocytes
2. Neurons
3. Astrocytes

But I need to confirm. For example, Apod in astrocytes. If Apod is the only astrocyte marker here, but other markers are oligodendrocyte, then maybe Astrocytes as third. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is OPCs (oligodendrocyte precursor cells), but none of the markers here are typical OPC markers like Pdgfra. 

Alternatively, since Ptgds might be in leptomeningeal cells, but that's a minor cell type. 

So the final answer is Oligodendrocytes, Neurons, Astrocytes. But I need to check if the markers for neurons and astrocytes are sufficient. 

Stmn4 is in neurons, Aplp1 possibly neurons. So two markers for neurons. Apod is one marker for astrocytes. 

But maybe the ranking would be Oligodendrocytes first, then possibly Schwann cells (if considering PNS), but the markers are mostly CNS. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but again, markers not present. 

Alternatively, since Aplp1 is in neurons and oligodendrocytes, but more in neurons. So Neurons as second. 

So the answer would be:

Oligodendrocyte, Neuron, Astrocyte

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, all markers are for oligodendrocytes, and the user wants three subsets? But the question says cell types. 

Alternatively, maybe the top three are all oligodendrocyte-related, but I think the user expects different cell types. 

Given the information, the most logical answer is:

1. Oligodendrocytes
2. Neurons
3. Astrocytes
