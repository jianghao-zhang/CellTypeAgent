Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Pgc: This gene encodes an aspartic proteinase that belongs to the peptidase family A1. The encoded protein is a digestive enzyme that is produced in the stomach and constitutes a major component of the gastric mucosa. This protein is also secreted into the serum. This protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen that includes a highly basic prosegment. This enzyme is converted into its active mature form at low pH by sequential cleavage of the prosegment that is carried out by the enzyme itself. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with susceptibility to gastric cancers. Serum levels of this enzyme are used as a biomarker for certain gastric diseases including Helicobacter pylori related gastritis. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 1. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]
- Pla2g1b: This gene encodes a secreted member of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) class of enzymes, which is produced by the pancreatic acinar cells. The encoded calcium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophospholipids. AA is subsequently converted by downstream metabolic enzymes to several bioactive lipophilic compounds (eicosanoids), including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). The enzyme may be involved in several physiological processes including cell contraction, cell proliferation and pathological response. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]
- Fxyd3: This gene belongs to a small family of FXYD-domain containing regulators of Na+/K+ ATPases which share a 35-amino acid signature sequence domain, beginning with the sequence PFXYD, and containing 7 invariant and 6 highly conserved amino acids. This gene encodes a cell membrane protein that may regulate the function of ion-pumps and ion-channels. This gene may also play a role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]
- mt-Co1: Contributes to cytochrome-c oxidase activity. Predicted to be involved in electron transport coupled proton transport and mitochondrial electron transport, cytochrome c to oxygen. Part of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Cfi: This gene encodes a serine proteinase that is essential for regulating the complement cascade. The encoded preproprotein is cleaved to produce both heavy and light chains, which are linked by disulfide bonds to form a heterodimeric glycoprotein. This heterodimer can cleave and inactivate the complement components C4b and C3b, and it prevents the assembly of the C3 and C5 convertase enzymes. Defects in this gene cause complement factor I deficiency, an autosomal recessive disease associated with a susceptibility to pyogenic infections. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a predisposition to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disease characterized by acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Primary glomerulonephritis with immune deposits and age-related macular degeneration are other conditions associated with mutations of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]
- Anxa10: This gene encodes a member of the annexin family.  Members of this calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways.  The function of this gene has not yet been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tspan1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tff2: Members of the trefoil family are characterized by having at least one copy of the trefoil motif, a 40-amino acid domain that contains three conserved disulfides. They are stable secretory proteins expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa. Their functions are not defined, but they may protect the mucosa from insults, stabilize the mucus layer and affect healing of the epithelium. The encoded protein inhibits gastric acid secretion. This gene and two other related trefoil family member genes are found in a cluster on chromosome 21. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Atp4b: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of P-type cation-transporting ATPases. The gastric H+, K+-ATPase is a heterodimer consisting of a high molecular weight catalytic alpha subunit and a smaller but heavily glycosylated beta subunit. This enzyme is a proton pump that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of H(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. It is also responsible for gastric acid secretion. This gene encodes the beta subunit of the gastric H+, K+-ATPase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Cystm1: Located in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Pgc, Pla2g1b, Fxyd3, mt-Co1, Cfi, Anxa10, Tspan1, Tff2, Atp4b, and Cystm1. I need to match these markers to specific cell types, considering their known expression patterns.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall their typical associations:

1. **Pgc (Pepsinogen C)**: This is a stomach-specific enzyme, produced in the gastric chief cells. It's involved in digesting proteins in the stomach. High specificity here suggests gastric or stomach-related cells.

2. **Pla2g1b (Phospholipase A2 group 1B)**: Expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. This enzyme is involved in lipid metabolism, part of the digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas.

3. **Fxyd3 (FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3)**: Often associated with ion transport, found in tissues like the stomach, colon, and certain glands. Might be linked to cells involved in ion regulation, such as parietal cells in the stomach.

4. **mt-Co1 (Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1)**: A mitochondrial gene involved in electron transport. High mitochondrial activity cells like muscle cells, but this is a common gene in many cells. Not super specific unless other markers point to a high-energy cell type.

5. **Cfi (Complement Factor I)**: Expressed in liver, but also in immune cells. However, since other markers are more digestive, maybe liver isn't the top here.

6. **Anxa10 (Annexin A10)**: Found in gastric mucosa, possibly in certain epithelial cells. Some studies link it to gastric adenocarcinoma.

7. **Tspan1 (Tetraspanin 1)**: Involved in cell surface interactions, found in various tissues but maybe in epithelial cells or certain immune cells. Not super specific.

8. **Tff2 (Trefoil factor 2)**: Produced in the stomach mucosa, specifically by mucous neck cells and pyloric glands. Important for mucosal protection and repair.

9. **Atp4b (ATPase H+/K+ transporting subunit beta)**: A subunit of the proton pump in gastric parietal cells. Very specific marker for parietal cells in the stomach.

10. **Cystm1 (Cystatin M1)**: Found in extracellular exosomes, but I'm not sure about its specific cell type. Might be in epithelial cells or secretory cells.

Now, putting this together. The presence of Pgc (chief cells), Atp4b (parietal cells), and Tff2 (mucous neck cells) all strongly point to gastric/stomach cells. Pla2g1b is pancreatic, which might suggest a different cell type, but since the majority here are stomach-related, maybe the top cell types are from the stomach.

Possible cell types:

1. **Gastric Chief Cells**: Because of Pgc. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, which aligns with Pgc's role.

2. **Parietal Cells**: Atp4b is a key marker here, as these cells produce stomach acid via the H+/K+ ATPase.

3. **Mucous Neck Cells**: Tff2 is a marker for these cells, which produce mucus in the stomach.

Alternatively, Pla2g1b could indicate pancreatic acinar cells, but since most other markers are gastric, pancreas might not be in the top 3. Another possibility is gastric epithelial cells in general, but the specific markers for chief, parietal, and mucous cells are more precise.

I should check if any of these genes are co-expressed in the same cell types. For example, parietal cells (Atp4b) might also express Fxyd3 as ion regulators. Chief cells (Pgc) might also have some mitochondrial activity (mt-Co1) due to their secretory function. However, the strongest indicators are the specific enzymes and pumps.

Thus, the top 3 cell types are likely:

1. Gastric Chief Cells
2. Parietal Cells
3. Mucous Neck Cells

Alternatively, maybe pancreatic acinar cells if Pla2g1b is considered a stronger marker, but given the rest, stomach cells are more prominent.
