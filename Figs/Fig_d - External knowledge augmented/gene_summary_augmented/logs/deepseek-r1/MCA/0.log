Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Mdk: This gene encodes a member of a small family of secreted growth factors that binds heparin and responds to retinoic acid. The encoded protein promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, in particular during tumorigenesis. This gene has been targeted as a therapeutic for a variety of different disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]
- Rbp1: This gene encodes the carrier protein involved in the transport of retinol (vitamin A alcohol) from the liver storage site to peripheral tissue. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for growth, reproduction, differentiation of epithelial tissues, and vision. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]
- Nrep: Predicted to be involved in axon regeneration; regulation of neuron differentiation; and regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway. Predicted to be active in cytoplasm and nucleus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Cdk4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tead2: Enables several functions, including DNA-binding transcription factor activity; disordered domain specific binding activity; and transcription coactivator binding activity. Involved in hippo signaling; positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; and protein-containing complex assembly. Located in cytosol and nucleoplasm. Part of TEAD-YAP complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Hmgn1: The protein encoded by this gene binds nucleosomal DNA and is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Along with a similar protein, HMG17, the encoded protein may help maintain an open chromatin configuration around transcribable genes. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
- Selenoh: This gene encodes a nucleolar protein, which belongs to the SelWTH family. It functions as an oxidoreductase, and has been shown to protect neurons against UVB-induced damage by inhibiting apoptotic cell death pathways, promote mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function, and suppress cellular senescence through genome maintenance and redox regulation. This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2016]
- Marcksl1: This gene encodes a member of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) family. Members of this family play a role in cytoskeletal regulation, protein kinase C signaling and calmodulin signaling. The encoded protein affects the formation of adherens junction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on the long arm of chromosomes 6 and 10. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]
- Mif: This gene encodes a lymphokine involved in cell-mediated immunity, immunoregulation, and inflammation. It plays a role in the regulation of macrophage function in host defense through the suppression of anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. This lymphokine and the JAB1 protein form a complex in the cytosol near the peripheral plasma membrane, which may indicate an additional role in integrin signaling pathways. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- H2afz: Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a replication-independent member of the histone H2A family that is distinct from other members of the family. Studies in mice have shown that this particular histone is required for embryonic development and indicate that lack of functional histone H2A leads to embryonic lethality.

Okay, so I need to figure out the top 3 cell types of mouse cells based on the given markers. Let me start by going through each gene and their summaries to see what cell types they are associated with.

First, Mdk (Midkine) is a growth factor involved in cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, especially in tumors. It's also responsive to retinoic acid. I know that Midkine is often expressed in certain neurons during development and in some cancers. Maybe neural cells?

Rbp1 (Retinol Binding Protein 1) transports retinol, which is important for epithelial differentiation and vision. Retinol metabolism is big in epithelial cells and liver, but since this is Rbp1, maybe epithelial cells? Also, the retina uses retinol, so maybe retinal cells?

Nrep (Neuronal Regeneration-Related Protein) is involved in axon regeneration and neuron differentiation. That's a strong indicator for neurons or neural progenitor cells.

Cdk4 is a cell cycle regulator, important for G1-S phase progression. High in proliferating cells, like stem cells or cancer cells. But specific cell types? Maybe stem cells or cells in active division, like progenitor cells.

Tead2 is part of the Hippo signaling pathway, involved in transcription regulation. Hippo pathway is important in organ size control, stem cell renewal. Tead2 might be in stem cells or rapidly dividing cells.

Hmgn1 is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, so cells that are actively transcribing genes, maybe stem cells, rapidly dividing cells, or certain immune cells.

Selenoh is a selenoprotein involved in protecting neurons and mitochondrial function. Selenoproteins are found in various tissues, but neuronal protection points to neurons again.

Marcksl1 is part of the MARCKS family, involved in cytoskeletal regulation. Found in cells with dynamic cytoskeleton changes, like macrophages or neurons.

Mif (Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor) is a cytokine involved in macrophage function and inflammation. Strong marker for macrophages or other immune cells like T cells.

H2afz is a histone variant important for chromatin structure. Replication-independent, so maybe in cells that are not dividing but need chromatin regulation, like mature cells, but also stem cells might use this.

Now, compiling this: 

Neurons come up a lot (Nrep, Mdk, Selenoh, maybe Marcksl1). Then, macrophages (Mif, Marcksl1 possibly). Epithelial cells (Rbp1, maybe Hmgn1). Proliferating cells like stem/progenitor (Cdk4, Tead2, H2afz, Hmgn1). 

But need to prioritize based on the combination. Let's see:

- Neuronal markers: Nrep (specific), Mdk (neural development), Selenoh (neuroprotection), maybe Marcksl1. So neurons are a top candidate.

- Macrophages: Mif is a key marker here. Marcksl1 might also be present. Macrophages are likely.

- Epithelial cells: Rbp1 is involved in retinol transport, crucial for epithelial differentiation. Hmgn1 in active chromatin might be present in epithelial cells undergoing differentiation.

Alternatively, stem cells: Cdk4, Tead2, H2afz. But which cell type is more likely with these markers? For example, Tead2 is involved in Hippo signaling, which is important in stem cells. Cdk4 is cell cycle, so maybe progenitor cells.

But considering the presence of Mif, which is a strong macrophage marker, that's a solid hit. So neurons, macrophages, and then maybe epithelial cells or stem cells.

Another angle: Look up known markers. For example, Mdk is expressed in certain neurons and some cancers. Rbp1 in liver and epithelial. Nrep is neuronal. Cdk4 in cycling cells. Tead2 in stem cells. Hmgn1 in active chromatin cells. Selenoh in neurons. Marcksl1 in macrophages? Or neurons. Mif in macrophages. H2afz in various, but maybe stem cells.

Putting it all together, the top three would be:

1. Neurons (Nrep, Mdk, Selenoh)

2. Macrophages (Mif, possibly Marcksl1)

3. Epithelial cells (Rbp1)

Alternatively, maybe stem cells as third? But Rbp1 is more specific to epithelial and liver. Since the user asked for mouse cells, maybe epithelial cells are more likely. Alternatively, liver cells, but Rbp1 is in liver for retinol transport. However, the presence of Hmgn1 and others may not fit liver as much. Alternatively, considering the combination, perhaps neural stem cells? But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the third is stem/progenitor cells (Cdk4, Tead2, H2afz). But how strong is that?

Wait, H2afz is a histone variant present in embryonic development, so maybe stem cells. But neurons and macrophages are more definite with their markers. So top 3: Neurons, Macrophages, and Epithelial cells. But need to confirm.

Another check: Let's see common markers for cell types.

Neuron markers: Nrep, maybe Mdk, Selenoh.

Macrophage markers: Mif, Marcksl1 (as MARCKS proteins can be in macrophages).

Epithelial: Rbp1, but also Tead2? Not sure. Tead2 is more about Hippo signaling, which is in epithelial morphogenesis as well. So maybe epithelial cells are third.

Alternatively, Proliferating cells (like stem cells or progenitors): Cdk4, Tead2, H2afz. But which cell type? Could be neural progenitors, but if other markers point elsewhere.

In conclusion, the top three are likely:

Neurons, Macrophages, Epithelial Cells.

But wait, Hmgn1 is in active chromatin, which could be in many cells, but maybe stem cells. Alternatively, Hepatocytes (liver) because of Rbp1, but other markers don't support that.

Alternatively, considering Tead2 and Cdk4, maybe the third is stem cells. But I need to weigh the specificity. Rbp1 is a strong indicator for epithelial or liver. Since the user is asking for mouse cells, and without more context, the most straightforward answer would be:

1. Neurons

2. Macrophages

3. Epithelial cells

Alternatively, maybe the third is hepatocytes. But without more markers pointing to liver, Rbp1's role in transporting retinol from liver storage suggests that hepatocytes might be the ones. But Rbp1 is the carrier from liver to tissues, so maybe the cells with Rbp1 are the ones receiving retinol, like epithelial cells. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of Rbp1 indicates cells that require retinol, like epithelial cells (for differentiation) or retinal cells. But in the absence of other retinal markers, epithelial is safer.

So final answer: Neurons, Macrophages, Epithelial Cells.
