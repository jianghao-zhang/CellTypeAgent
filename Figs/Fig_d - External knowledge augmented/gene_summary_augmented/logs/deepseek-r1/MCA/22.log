Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Reg3b: Gene ID not found
- Reg3g: This gene encodes a member of the regenerating islet-derived genes (REG)3 protein family. These proteins are secreted, C-type lectins with a carbohydrate recognition domain and N-terminal signal peptide. The protein encoded by this gene is an antimicrobial lectin with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Fabp2: The protein encoded by this gene is an intracellular fatty acid-binding protein that participates in the uptake, intracellular metabolism, and transport of long-chain fatty acids. The encoded protein is also involved in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. This protein binds saturated long-chain fatty acids with high affinity, and may act as a lipid sensor to maintain energy homeostasis. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
- Fabp6: This gene encodes the ileal fatty acid binding protein. Fatty acid binding proteins are a family of small, highly conserved, cytoplasmic proteins that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. FABP6 and FABP1 (the liver fatty acid binding protein) are also able to bind bile acids. It is thought that FABPs roles include fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism. Transcript variants generated by alternate transcription promoters and/or alternate splicing have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Lgals4: The galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The expression of this gene is restricted to small intestine, colon, and rectum, and it is underexpressed in colorectal cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Lypd8: Predicted to be involved in defense response to Gram-negative bacterium. Predicted to be located in extracellular region and plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in extracellular space. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Apoa1: This gene encodes apolipoprotein A-I, which is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein, which promotes cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion, and is a cofactor for lecithin cholesterolacyltransferase (LCAT), an enzyme responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesteryl esters. This gene is closely linked with two other apolipoprotein genes on chromosome 11. Defects in this gene are associated with HDL deficiencies, including Tangier disease, and with systemic non-neuropathic amyloidosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]
- Tff3: Members of the trefoil family are characterized by having at least one copy of the trefoil motif, a 40-amino acid domain that contains three conserved disulfides. They are stable secretory proteins expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa. Their functions are not defined, but they may protect the mucosa from insults, stabilize the mucus layer and affect healing of the epithelium. This gene is expressed in goblet cells of the intestines and colon. This gene and two other related trefoil family member genes are found in a cluster on chromosome 21. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Fabp1: This gene encodes the fatty acid binding protein found in liver. Fatty acid binding proteins are a family of small, highly conserved, cytoplasmic proteins that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. This protein and FABP6 (the ileal fatty acid binding protein) are also able to bind bile acids. It is thought that FABPs roles include fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]
- Prap1: Predicted to enable triglyceride binding activity. Involved in DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator resulting in cell cycle arrest; deactivation of mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint; and negative regulation of apoptotic process. Predicted to be located in endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular region. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The answer should be a list of three cell type names, ordered by probability from highest to lowest, separated by commas.

First, I need to go through each marker gene and recall which cell types they are associated with. Let me start by listing out each gene and their functions based on the provided summaries:

1. **Reg3b**: Gene ID not found, but Reg3g is in the same family. Reg3g is an antimicrobial lectin active against Gram-positive bacteria. These Reg3 proteins are often found in the intestine, particularly in Paneth cells or enterocytes, which secrete antimicrobial peptides.

2. **Reg3g**: As mentioned, it's part of the REG3 family, secreted by intestinal cells, likely Paneth cells or enterocytes.

3. **Fabp2**: Fatty acid-binding protein 2. This is known to be expressed in the small intestine, specifically in enterocytes. Fabp2 is involved in fatty acid uptake and metabolism.

4. **Fabp6**: Ileal fatty acid-binding protein. Expressed in the ileum, part of the small intestine. Associated with ileal enterocytes, possibly involved in bile acid binding.

5. **Lgals4**: Galectin-4, expressed in the small intestine, colon, and rectum. Found in epithelial cells, maybe goblet cells or enterocytes.

6. **Lypd8**: Involved in defense against Gram-negative bacteria. Located in the intestine, likely in epithelial cells, perhaps goblet cells or enterocytes.

7. **Apoa1**: Apolipoprotein A1, major component of HDL. Produced in the liver and intestine. In the intestine, it's associated with enterocytes involved in lipid metabolism.

8. **Tff3**: Trefoil factor 3, expressed in goblet cells of the intestines and colon. Protects mucosa and stabilizes mucus.

9. **Fabp1**: Liver fatty acid-binding protein, but also found in the intestine. Might be in hepatocytes, but also in enterocytes.

10. **Prap1**: Function related to triglyceride binding, involved in DNA damage response. Location in ER and extracellular region. Not sure about the exact cell type, but might be in intestinal epithelial cells.

Now, compiling these markers:

Most of the genes are associated with the small intestine, particularly enterocytes (Fabp2, Fabp6, Apoa1, Fabp1), goblet cells (Tff3, maybe Lgals4), and Paneth cells (Reg3g). Lypd8 is involved in defense against bacteria, which could be in enterocytes or goblet cells. Lgals4 is in colon and rectum epithelium. Prap1 is a bit unclear but might be in epithelial cells.

So, the key cell types here would be:

1. **Enterocytes**: These are the absorptive cells in the small intestine. Fabp2, Fabp6, Fabp1, Apoa1 are all involved in lipid metabolism and transport, which enterocytes do. Reg3g might be secreted by them or neighboring Paneth cells.

2. **Goblet cells**: Tff3 is a marker here, as it's produced by goblet cells. Lgals4 might also be expressed in goblet cells. Goblet cells secrete mucins and trefoil factors to protect the intestinal lining.

3. **Paneth cells**: Reg3g and Reg3b (if present) are antimicrobial peptides produced by Paneth cells located in the small intestine crypts. However, Reg3g can sometimes be expressed in enterocytes as well, depending on the context.

Wait, but some markers like Lypd8 and Prap1 are also present. Lypd8 is involved in defense against Gram-negative bacteria, which might be more in enterocytes. Paneth cells are more about Gram-positive bacteria. Maybe the combination points more towards enterocytes as the primary cell type.

Alternatively, could this be colonocytes (colon epithelial cells)? But most markers like Fabp2 and Fabp6 are more small intestine-specific. Lgals4 is in colon and rectum, but Tff3 is more small intestine and colon goblet cells.

So, considering the markers, the strongest signals are for enterocytes (multiple Fabps, Apoa1), goblet cells (Tff3, Lgals4), and Paneth cells (Reg3g). However, Reg3g might be more Paneth cell-specific. But sometimes in the literature, Reg3g is also expressed in enterocytes under certain conditions or in specific regions. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both Reg3g and Tff3 suggests a mix, but the task is to pick the top 3 cell types.

Another possibility is that these markers are from the small intestine epithelium, so the top three cell types would be:

1. Enterocytes (absorptive cells)
2. Goblet cells (mucus-secreting)
3. Paneth cells (antimicrobial)

Alternatively, if the markers are more specific to certain segments, like ileum (Fabp6), but I think the main cell types are those three.

However, let me double-check some markers:

- Fabp2: Small intestine enterocytes.
- Fabp6: Ileal enterocytes.
- Apoa1: Produced in liver and intestine; in intestine, by enterocytes.
- Tff3: Goblet cells.
- Lgals4: Intestinal epithelial cells, maybe surface cells.
- Reg3g: Paneth cells or enterocytes.
- Lypd8: Might be in enterocytes to prevent bacterial invasion.

So, enterocytes have multiple markers (Fabp2, Fabp6, Apoa1, Fabp1, Lypd8, possibly Lgals4). Goblet cells have Tff3 and maybe Lgals4. Paneth cells have Reg3g. Prap1 is uncertain but maybe in enterocytes.

Thus, the top three would be:

1. Enterocytes (most markers)
2. Goblet cells (Tff3, maybe Lgals4)
3. Paneth cells (Reg3g)

Alternatively, if the markers are more specific to the colon, but most Fabps are small intestine. So the answer is likely Enterocytes, Goblet cells, Paneth cells.

Enterocytes, Goblet cells, Paneth cells
