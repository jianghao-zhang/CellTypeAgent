Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Hexb: Hexosaminidase B is the beta subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase that, together with the cofactor GM2 activator protein, catalyzes the degradation of the ganglioside GM2, and other molecules containing terminal N-acetyl hexosamines. Beta-hexosaminidase is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, which are encoded by separate genes. Both beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunits are members of family 20 of glycosyl hydrolases. Mutations in the alpha or beta subunit genes lead to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons and neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses. Beta subunit gene mutations lead to Sandhoff disease (GM2-gangliosidosis type II). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

- C1qc: This gene encodes the C-chain polypeptide of serum complement subcomponent C1q, which associates with C1r and C1s to yield the first component of the serum complement system. C1q is composed of 18 polypeptide chains which include 6 A-chains, 6 B-chains, and 6 C-chains. Each chain contains an N-terminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal C1q globular domain. C1q deficiency is associated with lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]
- P2ry12: The product of this gene belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. This family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. This receptor is involved in platelet aggregation, and is a potential target for the treatment of thromboembolisms and other clotting disorders. Mutations in this gene are implicated in bleeding disorder, platelet type 8 (BDPLT8). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
- C1qa: This gene encodes the A-chain polypeptide of serum complement subcomponent C1q, which associates with C1r and C1s to yield the first component of the serum complement system. C1q deficiency is associated with lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis. C1q is composed of 18 polypeptide chains which include 6 A-chains, 6 B-chains, and 6 C-chains. Each chain contains an N-terminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal C1q globular domain. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2016]
- Cst3: The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions, where they appear to provide protective functions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. This gene is located in the cystatin locus and encodes the most abundant extracellular inhibitor of cysteine proteases, which is found in high concentrations in biological fluids and is expressed in virtually all organs of the body. A mutation in this gene has been associated with amyloid angiopathy. Expression of this protein in vascular wall smooth muscle cells is severely reduced in both atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aortic lesions, establishing its role in vascular disease. In addition, this protein has been shown to have an antimicrobial function, inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding a single protein. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Fcrls: Gene ID not found
- C1qb: This gene encodes the B-chain polypeptide of serum complement subcomponent C1q, which associates with C1r and C1s to yield the first component of the serum complement system. C1q is composed of 18 polypeptide chains which include 6 A-chains, 6 B-chains, and 6 C-chains. Each chain contains an N-terminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal C1q globular domain. C1q deficiency is associated with lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]
- Ctss: The preproprotein encoded by this gene, a member of the peptidase C1 family, is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that participates in the degradation of antigenic proteins to peptides for presentation on MHC class II molecules. The mature protein cleaves the invariant chain of MHC class II molecules in endolysosomal compartments and enables the formation of antigen-MHC class II complexes and the proper display of extracellular antigenic peptides by MHC-II. The mature protein also functions as an elastase over a broad pH range. When secreted from cells, this protein can remodel components of the extracellular matrix such as elastin, collagen, and fibronectin. This gene is implicated in the pathology of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and, given its elastase activity, plays a significant role in some pulmonary diseases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]
- Cx3cr1: Fractalkine is a transmembrane protein and chemokine involved in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes. The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for fractalkine. The encoded protein also is a coreceptor for HIV-1, and some variations in this gene lead to increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and rapid progression to AIDS. Four transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2010]
- Lgmn: This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but the biological validity of only two has been determined. These two variants encode the same isoform. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Hexb, C1qc, P2ry12, C1qa, Cst3, Fcrls, C1qb, Ctss, Cx3cr1, and Lgmn. 

First, I need to recall what each of these genes are associated with in terms of cell types. Let's go through each gene one by one using the provided summaries.

Starting with Hexb: The summary mentions it's part of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. Lysosomal enzymes are often found in cells with high degradative activity. Microglia, which are the resident macrophages in the brain, have high lysosomal activity. Other cell types with lysosomes might include other macrophages or maybe neurons, but microglia are a strong candidate here.

Next, C1qc, C1qa, and C1qb: These are all components of the complement system, specifically part of the C1q complex. The complement system is crucial in immune responses. Cells that produce complement proteins include macrophages and dendritic cells. Microglia also express complement proteins as part of their immune surveillance in the brain. Additionally, some B cells or other immune cells might produce these, but macrophages and microglia are more likely.

P2ry12: This gene encodes a G-protein coupled receptor involved in platelet aggregation. Wait, but P2ry12 is also known to be a marker for microglia. In the brain, microglia express P2ry12, which is involved in their chemotaxis and response to injury. Platelets do express P2RY12, but the context here is mouse cells, and if other markers point towards microglia, this would support that.

Cst3: Cystatin C, which is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases. It's found in high concentrations in body fluids and is expressed in many organs. Cystatin C is produced by various cells, including epithelial cells and macrophages. In the brain, microglia might produce this as part of their regulatory functions.

Fcrls: The gene wasn't found in the database summary, but I recall that FCRLS (Fc receptor-like S) is a marker specific to microglia in the brain. It's a surface protein expressed on microglia, distinguishing them from other macrophages.

Ctss: Cathepsin S, a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in antigen processing. This is found in antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages. Microglia, being the brain's macrophages, would also express this.

Cx3cr1: This is the fractalkine receptor, which is highly expressed in microglia and monocytes. In the brain, Cx3cr1 is a well-known marker for microglia. It's involved in their migration and adhesion.

Lgmn: Legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase. It's involved in processing proteins for MHC class II presentation. This is another lysosomal enzyme, so again pointing towards antigen-presenting cells like macrophages or dendritic cells. Microglia, as CNS-resident macrophages, would express this.

Putting this all together, many of these markers are strongly associated with microglia: Hexb (lysosomal), C1qa/b/c (complement components), P2ry12, Fcrls (specific to microglia), Cx3cr1, Ctss, and Lgmn. These are all indicative of microglial cells. 

However, there are also markers that might suggest other cell types. For example, P2ry12 is involved in platelets, but given the other markers, it's more likely pointing to microglia here. The complement components could also be in other macrophages or dendritic cells. But the combination with Fcrls and Cx3cr1 really narrows it down to microglia.

But wait, are there other cell types that share some of these markers? For example, other tissue-resident macrophages. Let's think. Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, etc. However, Fcrls and Cx3cr1 (especially high in microglia) might be more specific. Also, P2ry12 is a key microglia marker. 

So the top cell type is likely Microglia.

Next, looking for other cell types. The presence of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc (complement components) might also point to other macrophages or dendritic cells. But since we've already considered microglia as the first, perhaps the next would be other macrophages. But wait, Ctss (Cathepsin S) and Lgmn (Legumain) are also in dendritic cells. However, Cx3cr1 is more microglia and monocytes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second cell type could be Dendritic Cells. But let's check. Dendritic cells do express MHC class II related genes, Ctss, Lgmn. However, Fcrls is specific to microglia. C1q components are also produced by dendritic cells? Maybe, but C1q is more associated with macrophages and microglia. 

Alternatively, another possibility is that some of these markers are found in Osteoclasts. But Osteoclasts typically express markers like Acp5 (TRAP), Ctsk, etc., which aren't listed here.

Alternatively, Pericytes? No, they usually have different markers like Pdgfrb.

Alternatively, Monocytes: They do express Cx3cr1, but again, the combination with other markers here points more towards microglia. Monocytes might not have Hexb, Cst3 as strongly.

Another angle: The presence of multiple lysosomal enzymes (Hexb, Ctss, Lgmn) and complement proteins (C1q a/b/c) suggests a phagocytic cell type. Microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells are all phagocytic. However, the specific markers like Fcrls and P2ry12 tilt towards microglia. 

So if the first is Microglia, then the next could be Macrophages (tissue-resident). However, how to distinguish between macrophages and microglia? Since Fcrls is specific to microglia, the presence here suggests microglia as the first. Then, other macrophages might be second. But do the markers here include some that are common to both? For example, C1q components are in macrophages. Ctss and Lgmn are in macrophages as well. So if a cell has C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Ctss, Lgmn, but lacks Fcrls and P2ry12, then it's a macrophage. But in this case, Fcrls is present. Wait, the user provided Fcrls as a marker, but the summary says "Gene ID not found". But in reality, Fcrls is a known microglia marker. So assuming that the presence of Fcrls, along with P2ry12 and Cx3cr1, strongly points to microglia.

So the next cell type: Let's think about other immune cells. For example, dendritic cells (DCs). DCs express Ctss, Lgmn, maybe some complement components. But again, C1q is more associated with macrophages and microglia.

Alternatively, the markers could also point to a subset of macrophages, like perivascular macrophages, but those are still a type of macrophage. 

Alternatively, considering the presence of Cst3 (Cystatin C), which is expressed in various cells, including proximal tubule cells in the kidney, but that's probably not relevant here. 

Wait, another angle: P2ry12 is also expressed in platelets, but platelets are not nucleated cells, so if these are mouse cells (nucleated), then P2ry12 here is more likely microglia. 

So, the top three cell types:

1. Microglia - due to Hexb, C1q components, P2ry12, Fcrls, Cx3cr1, Ctss, Lgmn.

Then, what's next? Let's see which markers are left. The same genes might overlap with other cell types. For example, C1qa, C1qb, C1qc are part of the complement system, which is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and also by epithelial cells in some cases. But given the combination with lysosomal enzymes, maybe macrophages.

So the second cell type could be Macrophages. They share many markers with microglia, such as complement components, lysosomal enzymes (Hexb, Ctss, Lgmn), Cst3. But without the microglia-specific markers like Fcrls and P2ry12, they might be lower in the ranking. However, in this case, the markers include both microglia-specific and general macrophage markers, so the presence of Fcrls and P2ry12 would push microglia to the top, and the remaining markers might still indicate macrophages as the second.

Third cell type: Dendritic cells. They express Ctss, Lgmn, maybe C1q components? Not as much as macrophages. Alternatively, Monocytes. Monocytes in circulation express Cx3cr1, but once they differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells, they might downregulate some markers. 

Alternatively, another possibility: Osteoclasts, but as mentioned earlier, they have different markers. 

Alternatively, B cells? Not likely, since the markers here are more about lysosomal and phagocytic functions. B cells are more about antibody production. 

Alternatively, Astrocytes? They are brain cells, but their markers are typically GFAP, S100β, etc., which aren't listed here. 

Alternatively, Pericytes? As before, different markers. 

So, the second most likely could be Macrophages, and third could be Dendritic Cells. However, another angle: the presence of multiple complement components (C1q a, b, c) might point towards a cell type that secretes complement proteins. While the liver is the main source of complement proteins, hepatocytes produce most of them, but C1q is primarily produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. So if the cell is a macrophage, then yes. 

Alternatively, if the cell is a dendritic cell, but again, the combination with lysosomal enzymes might lean more towards macrophages. 

Wait, but microglia are a type of macrophage, so maybe the next is another type of macrophage. However, the question is about mouse cell types, so perhaps the answer is Microglia, Macrophages, Dendritic Cells. 

But let's check if any other cell type is more likely. For example, Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) would have similar markers to macrophages. But in general, tissue-resident macrophages would share many markers with microglia, except for the specific ones like Fcrls and P2ry12. 

Alternatively, considering that Cst3 is highly expressed in kidney proximal tubule cells, but again, other markers here are more immune-related. 

Another thought: The presence of Ctss (Cathepsin S) and Lgmn (Legumain) are involved in antigen processing, which is key for dendritic cells and macrophages in presenting antigens via MHC II. So dendritic cells would have these, but also macrophages. 

Alternatively, the third could be Monocytes, as precursors to macrophages and dendritic cells. Monocytes might express Cx3cr1, but not the other markers as strongly. 

Alternatively, considering that P2ry12 is also in platelets, but platelets are not nucleated. However, if this is a single-cell analysis, perhaps platelet contamination, but unlikely to be top 3. 

So, compiling all this:

1. Microglia
2. Macrophages
3. Dendritic Cells

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a different type of macrophage or a subset. But given the markers, these three seem the most likely. 

Wait, another check: Let's look up marker genes for these cell types to confirm.

Microglia markers: Hexb, C1qa/b/c, P2ry12, Tmem119, Fcrls, Cx3cr1, Ctss, etc. So the presence of these aligns.

Macrophage markers: C1qa/b/c, Ctss, Lgmn, Cst3. Yes, they would have these.

Dendritic cells: Ctss, Lgmn, maybe C1q components, but less so. Also, dendritic cells may have CD11c, which isn't listed here. However, without specific DC markers, but given the presence of Ctss and Lgmn, they could be a candidate.

Alternatively, another immune cell type: Monocyte-derived macrophages? But that's similar to macrophages.

Another possibility is that the third cell type is Osteoclasts, but again, markers don't align. 

Alternatively, B cells or T cells, but the markers here don't support that.

Therefore, the top three are likely Microglia, Macrophages, and Dendritic Cells.
