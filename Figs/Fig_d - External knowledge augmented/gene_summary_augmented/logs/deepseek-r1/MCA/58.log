Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Cd9: This gene encodes a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Tetraspanins are cell surface glycoproteins with four transmembrane domains that form multimeric complexes with other cell surface proteins. The encoded protein functions in many cellular processes including differentiation, adhesion, and signal transduction, and expression of this gene plays a critical role in the suppression of cancer cell motility and metastasis.

- Ear2: Enables DNA-binding transcription factor activity and sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding activity. Involved in negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Located in nucleus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Chil3: Gene ID not found
- Ccl6: DISCONTINUED: The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is no longer reporting records created for non-human orthologs.
- Ear1: This gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1. The encoded protein is a ligand-sensitive transcription factor that negatively regulates the expression of core clock proteins. In particular this protein represses the circadian clock transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (ARNTL). This protein may also be involved in regulating genes that function in metabolic, inflammatory and cardiovascular processes. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2013]
- Atp6v0d2: Predicted to enable proton transmembrane transporter activity. Predicted to be involved in vacuolar acidification and vacuolar transport. Located in apical plasma membrane. Part of vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Krt79: Keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into epithelial keratins and hair keratins. This gene encodes an epithelial keratin that is expressed in skeletal muscle, skin and scalp. The type II keratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q13.[provided by RefSeq, Jun 2009]
- Ctss: The preproprotein encoded by this gene, a member of the peptidase C1 family, is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that participates in the degradation of antigenic proteins to peptides for presentation on MHC class II molecules. The mature protein cleaves the invariant chain of MHC class II molecules in endolysosomal compartments and enables the formation of antigen-MHC class II complexes and the proper display of extracellular antigenic peptides by MHC-II. The mature protein also functions as an elastase over a broad pH range. When secreted from cells, this protein can remodel components of the extracellular matrix such as elastin, collagen, and fibronectin. This gene is implicated in the pathology of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and, given its elastase activity, plays a significant role in some pulmonary diseases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]
- Ctsd: This gene encodes a member of the A1 family of peptidases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate multiple protein products. These products include the cathepsin D light and heavy chains, which heterodimerize to form the mature enzyme. This enzyme exhibits pepsin-like activity and plays a role in protein turnover and in the proteolytic activation of hormones and growth factors. Mutations in this gene play a causal role in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-10 and may be involved in the pathogenesis of several other diseases, including breast cancer and possibly Alzheimer's disease. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Lgals3: This gene encodes a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding proteins. Members of this protein family have an affinity for beta-galactosides. The encoded protein is characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich tandem repeat domain and a single C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. This protein can self-associate through the N-terminal domain allowing it to bind to multivalent saccharide ligands. This protein localizes to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This protein plays a role in numerous cellular functions including apoptosis, innate immunity, cell adhesion and T-cell regulation. The protein exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on the given markers. First, I need to recall what each of these markers typically indicates.

Starting with Cd9: It's a tetraspanin involved in cell adhesion and signaling. I remember that Cd9 is often associated with stem cells, especially embryonic stem cells, and also with certain immune cells like macrophages or dendritic cells. Maybe also platelets?

Ear1 and Ear2: These are transcription factors. Ear1 is part of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 and might be involved in circadian rhythm and metabolism. Ear2 is similar, maybe involved in immune cells? I'm not too sure about these. They might be specific to certain immune cells or other cell types like neurons or liver cells. Wait, I think I've heard that Ears (Eosinophil-associated ribonucleases) are linked to eosinophils, but maybe that's a different family. Alternatively, Ear1 and Ear2 could be related to T cells or macrophages. Hmm.

Chil3: The gene ID wasn't found, but maybe Chil3 is Ym1, which is a chitinase-like protein. Ym1 is a marker for alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages) in mice. So Chil3 (Ym1) is a strong indicator for M2 macrophages.

Ccl6: The HGNC note says it's discontinued because it's a non-human ortholog. In mice, CCL6 is a chemokine, maybe involved in attracting monocytes or other immune cells. I think Ccl6 is expressed in macrophages as well.

Atp6v0d2: Part of the V-ATPase involved in proton transport, which is important in osteoclasts for acidifying the resorption area. Also, macrophages might express this during phagosome acidification. But osteoclasts are a type of macrophage lineage cell, so this could point towards osteoclasts or macrophages.

Krt79: Keratin 79. Keratins are usually in epithelial cells. Krt79 is specific to epithelial tissues, maybe in skin or hair follicles. However, some specialized epithelial cells like those in the stomach or other stratified epithelia might have this.

Ctss and Ctsd: These are cathepsins. Ctss is cathepsin S, involved in antigen processing in dendritic cells and macrophages. Ctsd is cathepsin D, lysosomal protease, also found in macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells. High in macrophages, dendritic cells, maybe some other lysosome-rich cells.

Lgals3: Galectin-3. This is a marker for macrophages, especially involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Also found in some epithelial cells and cancer cells, but commonly associated with macrophages.

Putting this together: The markers Cd9, Chil3 (Ym1), Ccl6, Atp6v0d2, Ctss, Ctsd, Lgals3 all point towards macrophages, especially M2 macrophages. Ear1 and Ear2 might be more specific to certain subsets. Krt79 is the odd one out here, as it's epithelial. But if this is a mixed population, maybe some epithelial contamination, but the majority markers are macrophage-related.

So the top cell type is likely macrophages, specifically M2 macrophages. Then, maybe dendritic cells because of Ctss and Cd9. Alternatively, osteoclasts because of Atp6v0d2. Let me check: osteoclasts express Atp6v0d2, Ctsk (but not Ctss?), and they are TRAP-positive. But Ctss is more in dendritic cells and macrophages. Alternatively, dendritic cells would have Cd9 and Ctss. But with Chil3 (Ym1) being M2, it's more likely macrophages. Then, maybe dendritic cells as second. Third could be osteoclasts or another myeloid cell. Alternatively, maybe epithelial cells because of Krt79, but that's only one marker. So perhaps the top three are M2 macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. Or perhaps the presence of Krt79 suggests a different cell type. Wait, Krt79 is keratin 79, which in mouse might be in specific epithelial cells, maybe tuft cells or some glandular epithelial cells. But if most markers are macrophage, then the top three would be: 1. Macrophages (M2), 2. Dendritic cells, 3. Osteoclasts. Alternatively, maybe other immune cells. Alternatively, maybe monocytes since some markers are shared. But given the combination, M2 macrophages are the strongest. Then, dendritic cells and maybe osteoclasts or other myeloid cells. Alternatively, since Ear1 and Ear2 are transcription factors, perhaps they are more specific. Ear2 is involved in T cell development? Not sure. Alternatively, neutrophils? But Ccl6 and Chil3 are more macrophage. Hmm. I think the top three would be: 1. Macrophages (M2), 2. Dendritic cells, 3. Osteoclasts. Alternatively, maybe microglia as a subset of macrophages, but probably not necessary here. Alternatively, considering Krt79, maybe a mixed population but that's less likely. So the answer is likely macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. But let me confirm each marker again. 

Cd9: Macrophages, dendritic cells, stem cells. 
Chil3: M2 macrophages. 
Ccl6: Macrophages. 
Atp6v0d2: Osteoclasts, macrophages. 
Ctss and Ctsd: Macrophages, dendritic cells. 
Lgals3: Macrophages. 
Ear1 and Ear2: Maybe eosinophils or another myeloid cell. Ear1's description mentions repressing ARNTL (a clock gene), so maybe involved in circadian regulation in certain cells. Not sure. 

So with all these, the strongest is macrophages (M2), followed by dendritic cells, then osteoclasts. But maybe alternatively, dendritic cells as second. Alternatively, given that Atp6v0d2 is specific to osteoclasts, which are a type of macrophage lineage. Wait, osteoclasts are derived from monocytes/macrophage lineage. So if Atp6v0d2 is a marker for osteoclasts, and other markers like Ctsd and Ctss are also present, but Chil3 (Ym1) is M2, maybe the combination suggests osteoclasts and M2 macrophages. But how to rank them. Maybe the main cell type is macrophages (M2), then dendritic cells, then osteoclasts. Alternatively, osteoclasts could be the second. Let me check: Atp6v0d2 is a subunit of the V-ATPase, which is highly expressed in osteoclasts. So if Atp6v0d2 is present, that's a strong indicator for osteoclasts. But then, Chil3 (Ym1) is M2 macrophage. So maybe there's a mix here. Wait, are osteoclasts considered a type of macrophage? They are derived from the same myeloid lineage but are a distinct cell type. So if the markers include both M2 macrophage markers and osteoclast markers, perhaps the cell type is a mix, but the user wants the top 3. So the presence of both Chil3 and Atp6v0d2 would suggest that the cell could be either M2 macrophage or osteoclast. But how to reconcile. Alternatively, in some contexts, certain cells might express both. For example, osteoclast precursors or activated macrophages. Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells. But Cd9 is present in dendritic cells. Let me check: Cd9 is also in dendritic cells. Ctss is in dendritic cells. Ctsd is in lysosomes, so present in many cells. Lgals3 is in macrophages. Ear1 and Ear2: unclear. Krt79 is epithelial. So if Krt79 is present, but only one epithelial marker, maybe it's a contaminant or a dual expression. But given that most markers are myeloid, the top cell types would be macrophages (M2), dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. So the order would be 1. Macrophages (M2), 2. Dendritic Cells, 3. Osteoclasts. Alternatively, if Atp6v0d2 is a stronger indicator for osteoclasts, maybe that's second. I need to prioritize based on the number of markers. For M2 macrophages: Chil3, Ccl6, Lgals3, Ctsd, Ctss, Cd9. That's 6 markers. For dendritic cells: Cd9, Ctss. For osteoclasts: Atp6v0d2, Ctsd (maybe), Ctss (maybe). So M2 macrophages have the most markers. Then, osteoclasts have Atp6v0d2 and maybe Ctsd. Dendritic cells have Cd9 and Ctss. So maybe the ranking is 1. Macrophages (M2), 2. Dendritic Cells, 3. Osteoclasts. Alternatively, osteoclasts could be second. But given that Chil3 is specific to M2, and Ccl6 also, the strongest is M2 macrophages. Then, dendritic cells with Cd9 and Ctss. Then, osteoclasts with Atp6v0d2. Alternatively, is there another cell type? Krt79 is in epithelial cells, but maybe a specialized one. But with only one marker, it's less likely. So the top 3 are M2 Macrophages, Dendritic Cells, Osteoclasts.
