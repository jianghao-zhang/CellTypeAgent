Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Camp: This gene encodes a member of an antimicrobial peptide family, characterized by a highly conserved N-terminal signal peptide containing a cathelin domain and a structurally variable cationic antimicrobial peptide, which is produced by extracellular proteolysis from the C-terminus. The protein plays an important role in innate immunity defense against viruses. In addition to its antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities, the encoded protein functions in cell chemotaxis, immune mediator induction, and inflammatory response regulation.

- Ngp: Gene ID not found
- S100a9: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in the inhibition of casein kinase and altered expression of this protein is associated with the disease cystic fibrosis. This antimicrobial protein exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- S100a8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in the inhibition of casein kinase and as a cytokine. Altered expression of this protein is associated with the disease cystic fibrosis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

- Chil3: Gene ID not found
- Ltf: This gene is a member of the transferrin family of genes and its protein product is found in the secondary granules of neutrophils. The protein is a major iron-binding protein in milk and body secretions with an antimicrobial activity, making it an important component of the non-specific immune system. The protein demonstrates a broad spectrum of properties, including regulation of iron homeostasis, host defense against a broad range of microbial infections, anti-inflammatory activity, regulation of cellular growth and differentiation and protection against cancer development and metastasis. Antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic activity has been found for this protein and its peptides. Activity against both DNA and RNA viruses has been found, including activity against SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2021]
- Wfdc21: Gene ID not found
- Lcn2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
- Fcnb: Gene ID not found
- Pglyrp1: Enables peptidoglycan binding activity and peptidoglycan immune receptor activity. Involved in antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptide; killing of cells of other organism; and response to bacterium. Located in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers provided are Camp, Ngp, S100a9, S100a8, Chil3, Ltf, Wfdc21, Lcn2, Fcnb, and Pglyrp1.

First, I need to recall which cell types are associated with these genes. Let's go through each gene one by one.

Starting with Camp: The summary says it's involved in innate immunity, antimicrobial activities, and produced by neutrophils. So Camp is a known marker for neutrophils.

Ngp: The gene ID wasn't found, but I remember that NGPP (Neutrophilic Granule Protein) is also a neutrophil marker. So even though the gene ID isn't found here, the abbreviation suggests it's related to neutrophils.

S100a9 and S100a8: These are S100 calcium-binding proteins. They form a heterodimer called calprotectin, which is highly expressed in neutrophils and monocytes. They are classic markers for myeloid cells, especially neutrophils and to some extent macrophages.

Chil3: The gene ID wasn't found, but Chil3 is also known as Ym1, which is a marker for alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages). But since the ID isn't found, maybe it's a typo or outdated symbol. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to another marker. However, if I can't find the gene, it's harder to place. But given the other markers, maybe it's less critical here.

Ltf: Lactotransferrin, which is found in neutrophil secondary granules. So another neutrophil marker.

Wfdc21: Gene ID not found. WFDC proteins are often associated with epididymal cells or other secretory cells, but without more info, maybe it's not the top marker here.

Lcn2: Lipocalin-2, expressed in neutrophils, and involved in bacterial defense. So another neutrophil marker.

Fcnb: Gene ID not found. FCNB might relate to ficolin, which is part of the complement system, possibly produced by hepatocytes or myeloid cells. But without more info, it's unclear.

Pglyrp1: Peptidoglycan recognition protein 1, which is involved in immune response to bacterial cell walls. Expressed in neutrophils and other immune cells.

Putting this all together: Most of the markers (Camp, Ngp, S100a9, S100a8, Ltf, Lcn2, Pglyrp1) are strongly associated with neutrophils. S100a8 and S100a9 are also found in monocytes and macrophages, but given the other markers, neutrophils are the strongest candidates. Some markers like Chil3 (if it's Ym1) might point to macrophages, but since multiple markers point to neutrophils, that's probably the top. Then, considering other cell types, monocytes/macrophages could be next. Alternatively, if there's a marker for dendritic cells or other granulocytes, but the S100 proteins are more myeloid. 

So the top three cell types would likely be:
1. Neutrophils
2. Monocytes (since S100a8/a9 are also present there)
3. Macrophages (since Chil3 could be Ym1 for M2 macrophages, but this is less certain)

Alternatively, maybe myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which also express S100a8/a9. But MDSCs are a type of immature myeloid cell. However, given that the majority of markers are neutrophil-specific, the top three would be neutrophils first, then monocytes, then macrophages. Or maybe granulocytes in general, but neutrophils are a subset of granulocytes. 

Wait, Ltf and Lcn2 are also in neutrophils. Ngp is a neutrophil marker. So the strongest is neutrophils. Then monocytes and macrophages. Alternatively, maybe other granulocytes like eosinophils, but I don't see specific markers for those here (like Siglec-F). So the top three are likely Neutrophils, Monocytes, Macrophages.
