Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Sprr1a: A structural constituent of skin epidermis. Involved in keratinocyte differentiation and peptide cross-linking. Located in cornified envelope. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Gstm1: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual's susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and efficacy of certain drugs. Null mutations of this class mu gene have been linked with an increase in a number of cancers, likely due to an increased susceptibility to environmental toxins and carcinogens. Multiple protein isoforms are encoded by transcript variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Krt15: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the keratin gene family. The keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into cytokeratins and hair keratins. Most of the type I cytokeratins consist of acidic proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains and are clustered in a region on chromosome 17q21.2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ly6d: Predicted to be involved in lymphocyte differentiation. Predicted to act upstream of or within response to stilbenoid. Predicted to be located in extracellular region and plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in cell surface. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Upk3a: This gene encodes a member of the uroplakin family, a group of transmembrane proteins that form complexes on the apical surface of the bladder epithelium. Mutations in this gene may be associated with renal adysplasia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]
- Gsta4: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. These enzymes are involved in cellular defense against toxic, carcinogenic, and pharmacologically active electrophilic compounds. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene encodes a glutathione S-tranferase belonging to the alpha class. The alpha class genes, which are located in a cluster on chromosome 6, are highly related and encode enzymes with glutathione peroxidase activity that function in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation products. Reactive electrophiles produced by oxidative metabolism have been linked to a number of degenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cataract formation, and atherosclerosis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Krt7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the keratin gene family. The type II cytokeratins consist of basic or neutral proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains coexpressed during differentiation of simple and stratified epithelial tissues. This type II cytokeratin is specifically expressed in the simple epithelia lining the cavities of the internal organs and in the gland ducts and blood vessels. The genes encoding the type II cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q12-q13. Alternative splicing may result in several transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Wfdc2: This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the WFDC domain family. The WFDC domain, or WAP Signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor in many family members. This gene is expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, and was also found to be expressed in some ovarian cancers. The encoded protein is a small secretory protein, which may be involved in sperm maturation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Sprr2a3: Gene ID not found
- Upk1a: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is found in the asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) where it can complex with other transmembrane 4 superfamily proteins. It may play a role in normal bladder epithelial physiology, possibly in regulating membrane permeability of superficial umbrella cells or in stabilizing the apical membrane through AUM/cytoskeletal interactions. The protein may also play a role in tumor suppression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 cell types in mouse cells based on these markers. Let me go through each gene one by one and see what they do.

Starting with Sprr1a: The description says it's involved in keratinocyte differentiation and part of the cornified envelope. So keratinocytes are skin cells, right? That's probably a marker for skin epithelial cells or something related to the epidermis.

Gstm1: This is a glutathione S-transferase, mu class. Detoxification enzymes. I remember that liver cells have a lot of detox functions, so maybe hepatocytes? Or other cells involved in detox, like certain epithelial cells.

Krt15: Keratin 15. Keratins are in epithelial cells. K15 is often a marker for stem cells in the hair follicle or stratified epithelia. Maybe basal keratinocytes?

Ly6d: Involved in lymphocyte differentiation. Ly6 proteins are often on immune cells, like T cells or B cells. So maybe a lymphocyte marker?

Upk3a: Uroplakin. Uroplakins are specific to the urothelium, the lining of the bladder. So this would mark urothelial cells.

Gsta4: Another glutathione S-transferase, alpha class. Also detox, similar to Gstm1. Maybe liver again or other detox organs.

Krt7: Keratin 7 is found in simple epithelia, like the lining of ducts and glands. So maybe glandular epithelial cells, like in the lung or breast.

Wfdc2: Expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells and ovarian cancers. Also involved in protease inhibition. Maybe lung epithelial cells, like Clara cells or alveolar cells?

Sprr2a3: Not found, but Sprr genes are part of the small proline-rich proteins, which are in the cornified envelope of the skin. So similar to Sprr1a, maybe another skin marker.

Upk1a: Another uroplakin, so again bladder urothelial cells.

Putting this together, the markers seem to point towards three main cell types:

1. Urothelial cells (due to Upk3a and Upk1a). Both uroplakins are very specific to bladder epithelium.

2. Keratinocytes in the epidermis (Sprr1a, Sprr2a3, Krt15). These are skin cells, especially the cornified layer.

3. Hepatocytes or other detox-related cells (Gstm1, Gsta4). Both are GST enzymes abundant in liver. Alternatively, maybe other epithelial cells involved in detox.

But wait, Krt7 is for simple epithelia, so maybe glandular cells. However, since the uroplakins are very specific, they should be number 1. Then skin keratinocytes. Then maybe liver cells. But also, Wfdc2 is in pulmonary cells. But Wfdc2 might be for lung or ovarian, but since the others are more specific, maybe liver is more likely. Alternatively, could there be a third cell type like lung epithelial? But I think the strongest are urothelial, epidermal keratinocytes, and then hepatocytes. Alternatively, maybe another epithelial type. Let me check again.

Another angle: Krt15 is also associated with stem cells in the hair follicle, but combined with Sprr1a and Sprr2a3, which are more general epidermal differentiation markers. So epidermal keratinocytes.

Gstm1 and Gsta4 are both GSTs. Liver cells have high GST activity, but other epithelial cells in organs like kidney or intestine might also express them. But without more specific markers, liver is a good bet.

So top 3 would be:

1. Urothelial cells (bladder)

2. Epidermal keratinocytes (skin)

3. Hepatocytes (liver)

Alternatively, if Krt7 and Wfdc2 are pointing to other epithelia, maybe lung, but I think the GSTs are stronger for liver. Let me confirm. Gstm1 and Gsta4 are both in the liver. So yes, hepatocytes would be third.

So the answer is: Urothelial cells, Epidermal keratinocytes, Hepatocytes
</think>

Urothelial cells, Epidermal keratinocytes, Hepatocytes
