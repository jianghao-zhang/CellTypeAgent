Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Sbp: This gene encodes a steroid binding protein that was first described as a plasma protein secreted by the liver but is now thought to participate in the regulation of steroid responses. The encoded protein transports androgens and estrogens in the blood, binding each steroid molecule as a dimer formed from identical or nearly identical monomers. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]
- Spink1: The protein encoded by this gene is a trypsin inhibitor, which is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into pancreatic juice. It is thought to function in the prevention of trypsin-catalyzed premature activation of zymogens within the pancreas and the pancreatic duct. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary pancreatitis and tropical calcific pancreatitis. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]
- 9530002B09Rik: Gene ID not found
- Defb50: DISCONTINUED: The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is no longer reporting records created for non-human orthologs.
- 5430419D17Rik: Gene ID not found
- Wfdc3: This gene encodes a member of the WAP-type four-disulfide core (WFDC) domain family. The WFDC domain, or WAP signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor. The encoded protein contains four WFDC domains. Most WFDC genes are localized to chromosome 20q12-q13 in two clusters: centromeric and telomeric. This gene belongs to the telomeric cluster. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed but their full-length nature has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Nupr1: Enables DNA binding activity and transcription coactivator activity. Involved in several processes, including regulation of cellular catabolic process; regulation of generation of precursor metabolites and energy; and regulation of programmed cell death. Acts upstream of or within negative regulation of cell cycle. Located in intercellular bridge; nucleoplasm; and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. Part of protein-DNA complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Azgp1: Involved in cell adhesion and detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of bitter taste. Located in extracellular space. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Agr2: This gene encodes a member of the disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins that catalyze protein folding and thiol-disulfide interchange reactions. The encoded protein has an N-terminal ER-signal sequence, a catalytically active thioredoxin domain, and a C-terminal ER-retention sequence. This protein plays a role in cell migration, cellular transformation and metastasis and is as a p53 inhibitor. As an ER-localized molecular chaperone, it plays a role in the folding, trafficking, and assembly of cysteine-rich transmembrane receptors and the cysteine-rich intestinal gylcoprotein mucin. This gene has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease and cancer progression. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2017]
- Tspan1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers provided are Sbp, Spink1, 9530002B09Rik, Defb50, 5430419D17Rik, Wfdc3, Nupr1, Azgp1, Agr2, Tspan1. Some of these genes are either not found or discontinued, so I'll focus on the ones with available descriptions.

Starting with Sbp: The summary mentions it's a steroid-binding protein secreted by the liver, involved in transporting androgens and estrogens. Liver cells (hepatocytes) come to mind since they produce plasma proteins. Also, maybe cells involved in steroid responses, like certain endocrine cells.

Spink1 is a trypsin inhibitor from pancreatic acinar cells. This is a strong indicator for pancreatic acinar cells. Spink1 is well-known as a pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, so that's a key marker here.

Wfdc3 has a WAP-type four-disulfide core domain, which is common in protease inhibitors. Some WFDC genes are expressed in reproductive tissues or respiratory tracts. For example, certain WFDC proteins are found in the epididymis or airways.

Nupr1 is involved in stress responses, regulation of apoptosis, and cell cycle. It's associated with various cancers and stress conditions. It might be found in stressed or proliferating cells, but not sure about specific cell types yet.

Azgp1 is involved in cell adhesion and bitter taste perception. It's also known as zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, which is secreted and has roles in lipid metabolism. It's found in epithelial cells, maybe in secretory tissues like mammary or salivary glands.

Agr2 is a disulfide isomerase involved in mucus production, specifically in the ER for folding proteins like mucins. This is prominent in goblet cells of the intestine or respiratory tract, which produce mucus.

Tspan1 is a tetraspanin involved in cell surface signaling, affecting cell motility and activation. Tetraspanins are widespread, but specific members are found in certain tissues. Tspan1 might be in epithelial or immune cells.

The other markers (9530002B09Rik, Defb50, 5430419D17Rik) are either not found or discontinued, so they might not contribute much. 

Putting this together: Spink1 points strongly to pancreatic acinar cells. Sbp suggests hepatocytes. Agr2 is indicative of goblet cells (intestinal or respiratory). Wfdc3 might be in epididymal or airway epithelial cells. Azgp1 could be in various secretory epithelia. Nupr1 is less specific but maybe in certain epithelial cancers or stressed cells. 

Top candidates would be pancreatic acinar cells (Spink1), hepatocytes (Sbp), and goblet cells (Agr2). Then maybe epididymal cells (Wfdc3) or others. But considering the strongest markers: Spink1 is very specific to pancreas, Sbp to liver, and Agr2 to goblet cells. So the top 3 are likely Pancreatic acinar cells, Hepatocytes, and Goblet cells.
