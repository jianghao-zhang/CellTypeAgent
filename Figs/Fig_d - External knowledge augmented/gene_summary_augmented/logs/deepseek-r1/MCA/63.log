Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Ctla2a: Gene ID not found
- 4930486L24Rik: Gene ID not found
- Prl8a2: Gene ID not found
- Rarres2: This gene encodes a secreted chemotactic protein that initiates chemotaxis via the ChemR23 G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain ligand. Expression of this gene is upregulated by the synthetic retinoid tazarotene and occurs in a wide variety of tissues. The active protein has several roles, including that as an adipokine and as an antimicrobial protein with activity against bacteria and fungi. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
- Erv3: This gene contains sequence derived from endogenous retrovirus, and is therefore similar to multiple other loci in the genome. Transcripts at this locus encode a conserved protein with a predicted signal peptide and similarity to the Env polyprotein. This protein is overexpressed in colorectal and other cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2017]
- Mrgprg: Predicted to enable G protein-coupled receptor activity. Predicted to be involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Predicted to be located in plasma membrane. Predicted to be integral component of membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Mt1: This gene encodes one of two high affinity forms of a receptor for melatonin, the primary hormone secreted by the pineal gland. This receptor is a G-protein coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is responsible for melatonin effects on mammalian circadian rhythm and reproductive alterations affected by day length. The receptor is an integral membrane protein that is readily detectable and localized to two specific regions of the brain. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus appears to be involved in circadian rhythm while the hypophysial pars tuberalis may be responsible for the reproductive effects of melatonin.

- Srgn: This gene encodes a protein best known as a hematopoietic cell granule proteoglycan. Proteoglycans stored in the secretory granules of many hematopoietic cells also contain a protease-resistant peptide core, which may be important for neutralizing hydrolytic enzymes. This encoded protein was found to be associated with the macromolecular complex of granzymes and perforin, which may serve as a mediator of granule-mediated apoptosis. Two transcript variants, only one of them protein-coding, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]
- Mt2: This gene encodes one of two high affinity forms of a receptor for melatonin, the primary hormone secreted by the pineal gland. This gene product is an integral membrane protein that is a G-protein coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor. It is found primarily in the retina and brain although this detection requires RT-PCR. It is thought to participate in light-dependent functions in the retina and may be involved in the neurobiological effects of melatonin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gpx3: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family, members of which catalyze the reduction of organic hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by glutathione, and thereby protect cells against oxidative damage. Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme is secreted, and is abundantly found in plasma. Downregulation of expression of this gene by promoter hypermethylation has been observed in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, including thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic myeloid leukemia. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on the given markers. First, I need to recall what each of these genes are associated with.

Starting with the markers provided: Ctla2a, 4930486L24Rik, Prl8a2, Rarres2, Erv3, Mrgprg, Mt1, Srgn, Mt2, Gpx3. Some of these have Gene IDs not found, so maybe they are less characterized or specific to certain cell types. Let's focus on the ones with descriptions.

Rarres2 (also known as Chemerin) is a chemotactic protein involved in immune responses, acting through the ChemR23 receptor. It's an adipokine and has antimicrobial properties. This might point towards immune cells or adipocytes. But since it's a chemotactic protein, maybe immune cells like macrophages or dendritic cells.

Erv3 is an endogenous retroviral gene expressed in colorectal and other cancers. Overexpression in cancers could indicate it's present in certain epithelial or cancer cells, but I'm not sure if that's specific enough.

Mrgprg is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in signaling, located in the plasma membrane. Mrgpr family members are often found in sensory neurons or mast cells. For example, Mrgprg is known in mice to be expressed in mast cells or certain neuronal populations.

Mt1 and Mt2 are melatonin receptors. They are involved in circadian rhythms and are found in the brain (suprachiasmatic nucleus) and retina. So cells expressing these might be neuronal or retinal cells. However, some immune cells can also express melatonin receptors.

Srgn (serglycin) is a proteoglycan found in hematopoietic cell granules. It's involved in granule-mediated apoptosis, associating with granzymes and perforin. This is a strong indicator of cytotoxic cells like natural killer (NK) cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

Gpx3 is a secreted glutathione peroxidase, abundant in plasma. It's involved in antioxidant defense. Secreted by various cells, including epithelial cells or possibly hepatocytes, but might be more general.

Now, looking at combinations. Srgn is strongly associated with cytotoxic granules, so NK cells or CTLs. Rarres2 (Chemerin) is produced by adipocytes but also attracts dendritic cells and macrophages. Mrgprg in mast cells. Mt1/Mt2 could be in neurons or immune cells. Prl8a2 is prolactin family 8, member A2, which in mice is associated with placental cells or reproductive tissues, but since the Gene ID wasn't found, maybe it's a red herring. Similarly, Ctla2a might be related to cytotoxic cells, like activated T cells or NK cells.

Putting it together: Srgn (cytotoxic cells) + Rarres2 (immune/chemotaxis) + Mrgprg (mast cells) might suggest immune cell types. If Srgn is in NK cells or CTLs, and Mrgprg in mast cells, but how do these combine? Maybe the strongest indicators are Srgn (cytotoxic cells) and Mrgprg (mast cells), Rarres2 (dendritic cells/macrophages). Alternatively, if Mt1/Mt2 are present in certain immune cells, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, adipocytes might express Rarres2, but then Srgn would be less likely. Maybe the presence of Srgn points to a hematopoietic cell type. Also, Gpx3 as a plasma protein might be from hepatocytes or endothelial cells, but not sure.

Wait, Srgn is in secretory granules of hematopoietic cells. So cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, mast cells. Mrgprg is in mast cells. So if both Srgn and Mrgprg are present, mast cells could be a candidate. Then Rarres2 (Chemerin) is produced by adipocytes but also acts on immune cells. If the cell is producing Chemerin, maybe adipocytes, but if it's expressing the receptor, maybe dendritic cells. But the gene here is Rarres2, which encodes the protein Chemerin, so the cell producing Chemerin would be adipocytes or epithelial cells. However, if the markers are genes expressed in the cell, then Rarres2 would be expressed in cells that secrete Chemerin, like adipocytes or liver. But also, some immune cells might express it.

Alternatively, if the cell has Srgn (cytotoxic granules) and Mrgprg (mast cells), perhaps mast cells are a top candidate. Then, Rarres2 might be from a different cell type, but maybe in the same context.

Another angle: Mt1 and Mt2 are melatonin receptors. These are found in the brain and retina, but also in immune cells. For example, T cells have been shown to express melatonin receptors. But if the cell has both Mt1 and Mt2, maybe it's a neuronal cell, but combined with Srgn (hematopoietic), that's conflicting. Unless it's a type of immune cell that also has melatonin receptors.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to list possible cell types based on the strongest markers:

1. Srgn: cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK cells, CTLs), mast cells, platelets?
2. Mrgprg: mast cells, sensory neurons
3. Rarres2: adipocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells
4. Mt1/Mt2: pineal gland cells, retinal cells, some immune cells
5. Gpx3: hepatocytes, kidney cells, endothelial cells?

If a cell has Srgn, Mrgprg, and Rarres2, what overlaps? Mast cells might have Srgn (as they have granules) and Mrgprg. Adipocytes have Rarres2 but not Srgn or Mrgprg. NK cells have Srgn but maybe not Mrgprg. Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells expressing Rarres2 and Srgn? Not sure.

Wait, Srgn is in hematopoietic cells' granules. Mast cells are hematopoietic, so Srgn could be present there. Mrgprg is in mast cells. Rarres2 might be expressed by mast cells? Or perhaps the cell is a mast cell. Let's check: Mast cells do express serglycin (Srgn) as a proteoglycan in their granules. Mrgprg is part of the Mrgpr family, which in mast cells are involved in IgE-independent activation. So mast cells would have both Srgn and Mrgprg. Then Rarres2 (Chemerin) could be from adipocytes, but if the cell itself is producing Chemerin, maybe it's an adipocyte. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a type of dendritic cell that expresses Chemerin to attract other immune cells.

Alternatively, maybe the top cell type is mast cells (due to Srgn and Mrgprg), then adipocytes (due to Rarres2), then NK cells (Srgn). But need to see which combinations make sense.

Another marker: Gpx3 is secreted, found in plasma. Hepatocytes produce many plasma proteins, so maybe hepatocytes. But Gpx3 could also be from kidney or other tissues.

But the presence of Srgn and Mrgprg together points more towards mast cells. Then, Rarres2 might be another cell type, but if all markers are in the same cell, perhaps it's a type of immune cell that secretes Chemerin. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a type of dendritic cell or macrophage that expresses Rarres2 and has granules (Srgn), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the melatonin receptors Mt1 and Mt2. If a cell has both, maybe it's a retinal cell or a pineal gland cell, but then why have Srgn and Mrgprg? That doesn't fit. So maybe immune cells that have melatonin receptors. For example, T cells or macrophages might express melatonin receptors, but combining that with Srgn and Mrgprg? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a cytotoxic T cell (Srgn) that also expresses Mrgprg and Rarres2. But I'm not sure if Mrgprg is expressed in T cells. Mrgprg is more associated with mast cells or sensory neurons.

Putting it all together, the top three cell types might be:

1. Mast cells (due to Srgn and Mrgprg)
2. Natural Killer cells (due to Srgn)
3. Adipocytes (due to Rarres2)

Alternatively, if Rarres2 is more indicative of macrophages or dendritic cells, but then Srgn is in cytotoxic cells.

Alternatively, another approach: Look up each marker's known cell types.

- Ctla2a: Maybe cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 2 alpha. I think in mice, Ctla2a is expressed in activated T cells, particularly regulatory T cells or activated CD8+ T cells.

- 4930486L24Rik: Not sure, but sometimes these RIKEN identifiers are for genes with specific expressions. Maybe check if it's a known marker for certain cells.

- Prl8a2: Prolactin family 8, member A2. Prolactin-related proteins are often expressed in placenta or reproductive tissues.

But since the Gene IDs for these three are not found, maybe they are not critical, or perhaps they are pseudogenes or less characterized.

Focusing on the ones with descriptions:

- Rarres2: Adipocytes, but also macrophages and dendritic cells.

- Srgn: Cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK, CTL), mast cells.

- Mrgprg: Mast cells.

- Mt1/Mt2: Pineal gland, retina, possibly some immune cells.

- Gpx3: Hepatocytes, kidney, plasma.

- Erv3: Cancer cells, maybe certain epithelial cells.

So combining Srgn and Mrgprg suggests mast cells. Then Rarres2 could be from adipocytes, but if the cell has Rarres2 along with Srgn and Mrgprg, maybe it's a mast cell that also expresses Rarres2? Not sure if that's common. Alternatively, the cell might be a dendritic cell expressing Rarres2, but with Srgn (unlikely). Maybe the markers are from a mixture, but the question is to find the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided.

Therefore, the strongest indicators are:

1. Mast cells (Mrgprg, Srgn)
2. Natural Killer cells (Srgn)
3. Adipocytes (Rarres2)

Alternatively, if Rarres2 is more associated with macrophages or dendritic cells, maybe those come in. But adipocytes are a strong candidate for Rarres2. Similarly, Mt1 and Mt2 could indicate neuronal cells, but without other neuronal markers, that's less likely. Gpx3 might be more general.

Another thought: Srgn is in platelets as well, but Mrgprg is not. So platelets are less likely.

So final answer: Mast cells, Natural Killer cells, Adipocytes. But I need to confirm if Srgn is indeed in mast cells. Yes, serglycin is a major proteoglycan in mast cell granules. Mrgprg is a mast cell marker. So mast cells would be first. Then NK cells because of Srgn. Third, adipocytes because of Rarres2. Alternatively, cytotoxic T cells could be second, but Srgn is in both NK and CTLs.

Alternatively, if the markers are from a single cell type, but that's unlikely. The question is about the top 3 cell types, considering all markers. So each marker may point to different cell types, but we need to rank based on the number of markers supporting each.

Mast cells have two strong markers: Mrgprg and Srgn.

Adipocytes have Rarres2.

NK cells have Srgn.

But perhaps Rarres2 is also expressed in some immune cells. For example, macrophages can produce Chemerin. If that's the case, then macrophages might be a candidate. But Rarres2's description says it's expressed in various tissues and upregulated by retinoids. So maybe adipocytes are the main source.

Alternatively, dendritic cells that present Chemerin to attract other immune cells via ChemR23. But would they also have Srgn? Not sure.

Alternatively, the presence of Mt1 and Mt2 might suggest a cell type with melatonin receptors. If it's a T cell, but then Srgn would be there if it's a cytotoxic T cell. But Mrgprg is not typical in T cells.

This is a bit challenging. To sum up:

1. Mast cells (Mrgprg, Srgn)
2. Natural Killer cells (Srgn)
3. Adipocytes (Rarres2)

Alternatively, if Rarres2 is in macrophages, then macrophages as third.

But given the information, I think the top 3 would be Mast cells, NK cells, Adipocytes.
