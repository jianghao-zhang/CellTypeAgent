Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Prm1: Predicted to enable DNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in DNA packaging. Predicted to act upstream of or within nucleus organization and spermatid development. Located in cytosol and nucleoplasm. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Prm2: Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis, and are the major DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus of sperm in many vertebrates. They package the sperm DNA into a highly condensed complex in a volume less than 5% of a somatic cell nucleus. Many mammalian species have only one protamine (protamine 1); however, a few species, including human and mouse, have two. This gene encodes protamine 2, which is cleaved to give rise to a family of protamine 2 peptides. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have also been found for this gene.

- Meig1: Predicted to act upstream of or within cellular protein localization; manchette assembly; and sperm axoneme assembly. Predicted to be located in cytosol and manchette. Predicted to be active in nucleus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ldhc:  Lactate dehydrogenase C catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate and NAD to pyruvate and NADH in the final step of anaerobic glycolysis.  LDHC is testis-specific and belongs to the lactate dehydrogenase family.  Two transcript variants have been detected which differ in the 5' untranslated region. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tnp1: Transition protein-1 is a spermatid-specific product of the haploid genome which replaces histone and is itself replaced in the mature sperm by the protamines (see PRM1, MIM 182880; PRM2, MIM 182890) (Luerssen et al., 1990 [PubMed 2249851]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]
- Fabp9: Predicted to enable lipid binding activity. Predicted to be involved in acrosome assembly. Predicted to be located in cytosol. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Tnp2: Predicted to enable zinc ion binding activity. Predicted to be involved in positive regulation of protein processing; single fertilization; and spermatogenesis, exchange of chromosomal proteins. Predicted to act upstream of or within binding activity of sperm to zona pellucida and flagellated sperm motility. Predicted to be located in nucleus. Predicted to be part of nucleosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Smcp: Sperm mitochondria differ in morphology and subcellular localization from those of somatic cells. They are elongated, flattened, and arranged circumferentially to form a helical coiled sheath in the midpiece of the sperm flagellum. The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the capsule associated with the mitochondrial outer membranes and is thought to function in the organization and stabilization of the helical structure of the sperm's mitochondrial sheath. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Rbakdn: Summary not found
- Ropn1l: This gene encodes a member of the ropporin family. The encoded protein is present in sperm and interacts with A-kinase anchoring protein, AKAP3, through the amphipathic helix region of AKAP3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]

Okay, let me try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these markers. The markers given are Prm1, Prm2, Meig1, Ldhc, Tnp1, Fabp9, Tnp2, Smcp, Rbakdn, Ropn1l. 

First, I'll go through each gene and see what they're associated with. 

Prm1 and Prm2 are protamines involved in packaging DNA in sperm. They replace histones during spermatogenesis. That's a strong indicator of sperm cells or spermatids. 

Meig1 is involved in sperm axoneme assembly and manchette formation. The manchette is a structure in developing sperm, so again pointing towards spermatids.

Ldhc is lactate dehydrogenase C, which is testis-specific and involved in glycolysis in sperm. So this is another marker for sperm cells.

Tnp1 and Tnp2 are transition proteins 1 and 2. These are involved in replacing histones during spermiogenesis, which is part of sperm maturation. They are specific to spermatids as well.

Fabp9 is involved in acrosome assembly. The acrosome is part of the sperm head, important for fertilization. So another sperm-related marker.

Smcp is the sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein. It's involved in the mitochondrial sheath in the sperm midpiece. Definitely a sperm marker.

Ropn1l interacts with AKAP3 in sperm, which is related to sperm motility. 

Rbakdn... Hmm, the summary wasn't found, but maybe it's a typo? Maybe Rbak or another gene related to sperm? Not sure, but the other markers are already heavily sperm-related.

Putting this all together, all these markers are involved in spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, or sperm-specific structures. So the cell types are likely various stages of sperm cells. The primary cell types would be spermatids (since transition proteins and protamines are involved in their development), mature spermatozoa, and maybe secondary spermatocytes. But since most markers point to later stages, like spermatids and spermatozoa, maybe the top three are: Spermatids, Spermatozoa, and possibly Spermatocytes. But given that Tnp and Prm are more specific to spermatids and spermatozoa, those would be top. Maybe Sertoli cells? No, Sertoli cells are support cells, not expressing these markers. Leydig cells? They produce testosterone, not involved in sperm structure. So the top 3 are likely all sperm-related: Spermatids, Spermatozoa, and maybe Spermatocytes, but probably in order of maturation. Since Prm1 and Prm2 are in later stages, the first would be spermatids (as they undergo the transition), then spermatozoa. Maybe secondary spermatocytes are earlier. But given the markers, the top 3 would be Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and possibly Spermatocyte. Alternatively, maybe testicular cells, but those are too generic. 

Wait, another thought: some markers could be specific to different stages. For example, transition proteins (Tnp1, Tnp2) are in round spermatids, protamines in elongating spermatids. So maybe the cell types are different stages of spermatids. But the question asks for cell types, not specific stages. In that case, the main cell types would be Spermatozoa, Spermatid, and maybe Spermatocyte. But I think Spermatid and Spermatozoa are the main ones. Maybe the third is Spermatogonia? No, those are stem cells. Alternatively, maybe Leydig or Sertoli, but no markers here. So probably top 3 are Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe Spermatocyte. But since the majority of markers are in spermiogenesis (spermatid to spermatozoa), maybe the list is Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and Spermatocyte. Alternatively, perhaps another cell type in the testis. But given all the markers are sperm-specific, the top 3 must be sperm-related. So the answer is Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe Spermatocyte. But I need to check the exact terminology. In mouse, the stages are spermatogonia, spermatocytes (primary and secondary), spermatids (round and elongating), and spermatozoa. So the markers here are from spermatids (Tnp, Prm) and spermatozoa (Smcp, Ldhc). So maybe the top 3 cell types are Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe another type like Sperm cells (which is same as spermatozoa). Wait, maybe the third is Sertoli cell? But no markers here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is all three stages of spermatogenic cells: Spermatocytes, Spermatids, Spermatozoa. But the order would be based on expression. Prm1 and Prm2 are in spermatids, so Spermatid first, then Spermatozoa. The third could be Spermatocyte, but Ldhc is testis-specific, maybe in later stages. Alternatively, maybe Leydig cells, but no. So the top 3 are Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and Spermatocyte. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, since some markers are also in the manchette (Meig1), which is in spermatids. Smcp is in sperm midpiece, so spermatozoa. So perhaps the top three are: 1. Spermatid, 2. Spermatozoa, 3. Spermatocyte. Or maybe Spermatozoa is first? Wait, Prm1 and Prm2 are in spermatozoa's DNA packaging. But during spermatid stage, the transition from histones to protamines occurs. So maybe spermatid is the main cell type here, then spermatozoa. Alternatively, maybe the answer is all three are different stages of sperm cells. But the user wants top 3 cell types. Since all markers are sperm-related, but some specific to different phases. The most likely cell types are Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe Spermatocyte. But I think Spermatocyte is earlier, and the markers here are more in spermiogenesis. So the top 3 would be Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe another testicular cell type, but since all markers are in sperm, probably Spermatid, Spermatozoa, Spermatocyte. Alternatively, maybe the third is Sertoli cell, but there's no marker supporting that. So final answer: Spermatid, Spermatozoa, Spermatocyte. But I should check if any other cell types use these markers. For example, Ldhc is testis-specific but in sperm. All these genes are involved in spermatogenesis. So the cell types are all in the male germ line. Therefore, the top 3 cell types are Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and Spermatocyte. Alternatively, maybe Sperm is the general term, but in scientific terms, they are called spermatozoa. So the list would be: Spermatid, Spermatozoa, Spermatocyte. But since some sources might list them as different, but perhaps Spermatid is the main one here. Wait, maybe the user expects the answer to be all sperm-related, so the three could be: Spermatid, Spermatozoa, and maybe Testicular Germ Cells. But the standard answer would be Spermatid, Spermatozoa, Spermatocyte. So I'll go with that.
