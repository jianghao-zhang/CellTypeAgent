Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Rps13-ps1: Gene ID not found
- Rps3a3: Gene ID not found
- Dppa5a: Gene ID not found
- Gm10036: Gene ID not found
- Gm11942: Gene ID not found
- Tdgf1: This gene encodes an epidermal growth factor-related protein that contains a cripto, FRL-1, and cryptic domain. The encoded protein is an extracellular, membrane-bound signaling protein that plays an essential role in embryonic development and tumor growth. Mutations in this gene are associated with forebrain defects. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 8, 19 and X. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]
- Gm15459: Gene ID not found
- Stmn2: This gene encodes a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins. Stathmin proteins function in microtubule dynamics and signal transduction. The encoded protein plays a regulatory role in neuronal growth and is also thought to be involved in osteogenesis. Reductions in the expression of this gene have been associated with Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]
- Chchd10: This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is enriched at cristae junctions in the intermembrane space. It may play a role in cristae morphology maintenance or oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in this gene cause frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-2. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 7 and 19. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2014]
- Tdh: Enables identical protein binding activity. Predicted to be involved in isoleucine biosynthetic process and threonine catabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytosol. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on the given markers. First, I need to look at each gene and see what cell types they are associated with.

Starting with Tdgf1. The summary says it's involved in embryonic development and tumor growth. So maybe embryonic stem cells or germ cells? Since it's crucial in development, perhaps stem cells.

Next, Stmn2. The description mentions it's involved in neuronal growth. So neurons or neural progenitor cells. Also linked to Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's, so definitely neural-related.

Chchd10 is a mitochondrial protein associated with cristae junctions. Mutations here cause frontotemporal dementia and ALS. Mitochondrial function is important in many cells, but neurons again might be a candidate here. Maybe muscle cells too, but given the dementia link, neurons again.

Dppa5a, even though the gene ID wasn't found, I recall that Dppa5a is a known marker for pluripotent stem cells, like embryonic stem cells. So that's another hint towards stem cells.

Tdh (threonine dehydrogenase) is involved in threonine catabolism. High metabolic activity cells? Maybe liver cells, but also stem cells might have high metabolic demands.

Rps13-ps1 and Rps3a3 are ribosomal proteins, which are often housekeeping genes. Not specific but maybe indicate proliferating cells, like stem cells or progenitor cells.

Gm genes (Gm10036, Gm11942, Gm15459) are not found, so not helpful. 

Putting this together: Tdgf1 and Dppa5a point towards embryonic stem cells. Stmn2 and Chchd10 suggest neuronal cells. Tdh could be either stem or metabolic cells. Since embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, they might express both developmental and some neural markers. Alternatively, maybe germ cells also express some of these, but I think embryonic stem cells are more likely. Neurons would be the second. Then maybe another cell type with high mitochondrial activity, but given the presence of Stmn2 and Chchd10, perhaps neural progenitor cells. Alternatively, maybe some other stem cells. Let me check: Tdgf1 (also known as Cripto) is a marker for embryonic stem cells. Dppa5a is also a pluripotency marker. Stmn2 is a neuronal marker. Chchd10 might be in neurons or muscle. So the top three would be Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, and maybe Neural Progenitor Cells. Alternatively, if Tdh is in liver, but I think Neuronal is more likely. So the list would be Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, and Neural Progenitor Cells. Wait, but maybe Germ Cells? Dppa5a is also expressed in germ cells. Hmm. Let me think. Dppa5a is indeed a germ cell marker in some contexts, but also in embryonic stem cells. Tdgf1 is more embryonic. So maybe Embryonic Stem Cells first, then Neurons, then Germ Cells. Alternatively, if Stmn2 is more specific to neurons, then Neurons would be second. Let me confirm Stmn2: Stathmin-2 is expressed in neurons. So yes, neurons. Third could be Germ Cells. Alternatively, maybe another cell type like Progenitor Cells. But given the markers, the top three are likely Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, and Germ Cells. Wait, but Tdgf1 is also involved in tumor growth, maybe some cancer cells, but the question is about mouse cell types. I think the answer is Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, Germ Cells. But maybe Neural Progenitor instead of Germ Cells. Let me check another angle. Tdh: threonine dehydrogenase. In the liver, but also in stem cells? Not sure. But given Dppa5a and Tdgf1, embryonic stem cells are top. Neurons next. Third could be Germ Cells or Neural Progenitors. I think the answer is Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, Germ Cells. Let me check Dppa5a again. Yes, Dppa5a is a pluripotency marker in embryonic stem cells and germ cells. So maybe both. So the top three would be Embryonic Stem Cells, Germ Cells, Neurons. But which is higher? Tdgf1 is more embryonic development. Stmn2 is neural. So perhaps Embryonic Stem Cells first, then Neurons, then Germ Cells. Alternatively, Germ Cells might be third. So the final answer: Embryonic Stem Cells, Neurons, Germ Cells.
