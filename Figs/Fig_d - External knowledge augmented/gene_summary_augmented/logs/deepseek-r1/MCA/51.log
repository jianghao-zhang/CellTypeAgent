Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Chga: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. It is found in secretory vesicles of neurons and endocrine cells. This gene product is a precursor to three biologically active peptides; vasostatin, pancreastatin, and parastatin. These peptides act as autocrine or paracrine negative modulators of the neuroendocrine system. Two other peptides, catestatin and chromofungin, have antimicrobial activity and antifungal activity, respectively. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]
- Pcsk2: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may increase susceptibility to myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. This gene may also play a role in tumor development and progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]
- Chgb: This gene encodes a tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein abundant in peptidergic endocrine cells and neurons. This protein may serve as a precursor for regulatory peptides. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]
- Pyy: This gene encodes a member of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate two alternative peptide products that differ in length by three amino acids. These peptides, secreted by endocrine cells in the gut, exhibit different binding affinities for each of the neuropeptide Y receptors. Binding of the encoded peptides to these receptors mediates regulation of pancreatic secretion, gut mobility and energy homeostasis. Rare variations in this gene could increase susceptibility to obesity and elevated serum levels of the encoded peptides may be associated with anorexia nervosa. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]
- Pcsk1n: The protein encoded by this gene functions as an inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1, which regulates the proteolytic cleavage of neuroendocrine peptide precursors. The proprotein is further processed into multiple short peptides. A polymorphism within this gene may be associated with obesity. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]
- Iapp: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones. This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit reduced levels of the encoded hormone in blood and pancreas. This protein also exhibits a bactericidal, antimicrobial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]
- Resp18: Predicted to act upstream of or within in utero embryonic development. Predicted to be located in Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicle. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ins2: Gene ID not found
- Gcg: The protein encoded by this gene is actually a preproprotein that is cleaved into four distinct mature peptides. One of these, glucagon, is a pancreatic hormone that counteracts the glucose-lowering action of insulin by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon is a ligand for a specific G-protein linked receptor whose signalling pathway controls cell proliferation. Two of the other peptides are secreted from gut endocrine cells and promote nutrient absorption through distinct mechanisms. Finally, the fourth peptide is similar to glicentin, an active enteroglucagon. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Scg2: This gene encodes menin, a tumor suppressor associated with a syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Menin is a scaffold protein that functions in histone modification and epigenetic gene regulation. It is thought to regulate several pathways and processes by altering chromatin structure through the modification of histones. [provided by RefSeq, May 2019]

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types here. The markers given are Chga, Pcsk2, Chgb, Pyy, Pcsk1n, Iapp, Resp18, Ins2, Gcg, Scg2.

First, I remember that chromogranins like Chga and Chgb are typically found in neuroendocrine cells. So maybe something like enteroendocrine cells in the gut or pancreatic endocrine cells. Pcsk2 is a proprotein convertase involved in processing peptide hormones, which also points to secretory cells, like endocrine or neuroendocrine cells.

Looking at Pyy, that's Peptide YY, which I think is produced by L-cells in the intestine, which are a type of enteroendocrine cell. Gcg is glucagon, which is produced by alpha cells in the pancreas. Ins2 is insulin 2, which would be beta cells in the pancreas. Iapp is islet amyloid polypeptide, which is co-secreted with insulin by beta cells. So beta cells would have Ins2 and Iapp. But wait, the presence of both Gcg and Ins2 might suggest a mix, but maybe the cell type is pancreatic islet cells in general. But since beta cells are a major part of islets, maybe beta cells are one. But there's also Gcg, which is alpha cells. Hmm, but the markers might be overlapping.

Wait, maybe the cell type here is a pancreatic islet cell that can have multiple hormones, but typically beta cells express Ins2 and Iapp, while alpha cells express Gcg. If the markers include both, maybe it's a mixed population or a cell type that co-expresses these? But that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a gut enteroendocrine cell, which can express Pyy, Gcg (as in L-cells which produce GLP-1, which is derived from proglucagon, hence Gcg), and also chromogranins.

Looking at Scg2, secretogranin II, which is another neuroendocrine marker. So combining all these markers, they are all associated with secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. So possible cell types: pancreatic beta cells, pancreatic alpha cells, enteroendocrine cells. But which ones are most likely given the combination?

Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2 are all general neuroendocrine markers. Then specific hormones: Ins2 (beta), Gcg (alpha), Pyy (enteroendocrine), Iapp (beta). So if a cell has Ins2 and Iapp, that's beta. If it has Gcg, that's alpha. But if all these markers are present in the same cell, maybe it's a pancreatic islet cell type, but typically beta and alpha are separate. However, maybe the question is looking for cell types in general, not specific subtypes. Alternatively, maybe enteroendocrine cells, which can express Pyy, Gcg (as in L-cells), and the chromogranins. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a pancreatic beta cell, since Ins2 and Iapp are specific to beta cells, and they also express Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, etc. But then Gcg is more alpha. Wait, but maybe the markers are from a list that could be present in different cell types. The user is providing all markers for a single cell type? Wait, the question says "using the following markers" for a single cell. So the cell would express all these markers. But that's conflicting because Ins2 is beta, Gcg is alpha. Unless it's a cell that's not in the pancreas. Wait, Pyy is more intestinal. So maybe enteroendocrine L-cells, which produce Pyy and GLP-1 (from Gcg). Enteroendocrine cells do express chromogranins, Pcsk2 (needed for processing prohormones), and Scg2. So maybe enteroendocrine cells are the top. Then pancreatic beta cells (Ins2, Iapp, Chga, etc.), and maybe pancreatic alpha cells (Gcg, Chga, etc.)?

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a pancreatic beta cell. Let's check the markers: Chga, Pcsk2, Chgb (neuroendocrine markers), Pyy (usually intestinal, but maybe?), Pcsk1n (prohormone convertase inhibitor), Iapp (beta), Ins2 (beta), Gcg (alpha?), Scg2. Wait, but beta cells don't express Gcg. Alpha cells do. So maybe the presence of both Ins2 and Gcg suggests that the markers are from a mixture, but the user is asking for a single cell type. That's a problem. Unless there's a cell type that co-expresses these. Alternatively, maybe the cell is an intestinal enteroendocrine cell (like L-cell) which produces Pyy and GLP-1 (from Gcg), and has the neuroendocrine markers. Then, maybe beta cells would have Ins2 and Iapp, but not Gcg. So maybe the top 3 cell types are:

1. Enteroendocrine cells (L-cells) - because of Pyy, Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2.

2. Pancreatic beta cells - because of Ins2, Iapp, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2.

3. Pancreatic alpha cells - because of Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2.

But I need to verify. Let me think again. Enteroendocrine L-cells: Pyy and Gcg (since Gcg is processed into GLP-1 and other peptides in the gut). So markers like Pyy, Gcg, plus the general neuroendocrine markers (Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2) would point to L-cells. Beta cells have Ins2 and Iapp. So if the markers include Ins2 and Iapp, that's beta. But then Gcg is not in beta cells. So unless the cell is a mixed population, which isn't the case here. Therefore, if all markers are present in one cell, maybe it's not possible. But perhaps the user is considering a list of possible markers that could be from different cells, but the task is to find the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided. So each marker may indicate a different cell type. For example, Ins2 and Iapp point to beta cells, Gcg to alpha, Pyy to enteroendocrine, and the rest are general neuroendocrine. So maybe the top 3 cell types are:

1. Pancreatic beta cells (Ins2, Iapp, plus neuroendocrine markers)

2. Enteroendocrine cells (Pyy, Gcg, neuroendocrine markers)

3. Pancreatic alpha cells (Gcg, neuroendocrine markers)

But which one has higher probability? If the cell has both Ins2 and Gcg, that's conflicting. But maybe the markers are from a bulk analysis, not single-cell. But the question says "mouse cells", so maybe individual cells. But if a single cell expresses all these markers, that's conflicting. However, perhaps some markers are more specific. For example, Ins2 is very specific to beta cells. Similarly, Pyy is specific to enteroendocrine L-cells. So maybe the markers are from a mixture of cell types, but the task is to list the top 3 cell types present in the sample based on the markers provided. In that case, the presence of Ins2 and Iapp would indicate beta cells, Gcg indicates alpha, Pyy indicates enteroendocrine. Then the top 3 would be beta cells, enteroendocrine cells, alpha cells. Alternatively, if the markers are all co-expressed in a single cell type, which is unlikely, but maybe a progenitor cell? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe neuroendocrine cells in general, but the question requires specific cell types.

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a pancreatic islet cell (beta, alpha, delta, etc.), but the markers point to beta and enteroendocrine. Given that, I think the most probable cell types based on the markers are:

1. Pancreatic beta cells (due to Ins2, Iapp, and general neuroendocrine markers)

2. Enteroendocrine cells (due to Pyy, Gcg, neuroendocrine markers)

3. Pancreatic alpha cells (due to Gcg, neuroendocrine markers)

But another possibility is that some markers are more heavily weighted. For example, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2 are all general neuroendocrine, but then specific hormones. So the presence of Ins2 and Iapp would strongly indicate beta cells. If the markers are from a single cell, then a beta cell would have Ins2, Iapp, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2, etc. But then why is there Gcg? Unless there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a gut cell that also produces insulin, but that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe beta cells express some of these other genes. Wait, according to the gene summaries, Gcg encodes proglucagon, which in the pancreas is processed into glucagon (alpha cells), but in the intestine, it's processed into GLP-1 and GLP-2 (L-cells). So if the cell has Gcg, it could be either alpha or L-cells, depending on other markers. If the cell also has Ins2, that's beta cell specific. But beta cells don't express Gcg. Therefore, the presence of both Ins2 and Gcg in the same cell is conflicting. Unless it's a cell line or a tumor cell, but the question is about normal mouse cells.

In that case, maybe the markers are from different cells. The user might have provided a list of markers from a heterogeneous sample, and we need to identify the top 3 cell types present. So the presence of Ins2 would indicate beta cells, Gcg indicates alpha cells, Pyy indicates enteroendocrine cells, and the rest are general neuroendocrine. So the top 3 would be:

1. Pancreatic beta cells

2. Enteroendocrine cells

3. Pancreatic alpha cells

Alternatively, if the markers are all from the same cell type, but that's impossible. So the answer must be that the top 3 cell types present in the sample are beta cells, enteroendocrine cells, and alpha cells, based on the specific markers. So the list would be ranked by the number of markers specific to each. Beta cells have Ins2 and Iapp, which are very specific. Enteroendocrine cells have Pyy and Gcg (as in L-cells). Alpha cells have Gcg. So beta first, then enteroendocrine, then alpha.
