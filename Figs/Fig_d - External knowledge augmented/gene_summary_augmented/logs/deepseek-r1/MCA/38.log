Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Acta2: This gene encodes one of six different actin proteins. Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in cell motility, structure, integrity, and intercellular signaling. The encoded protein is a smooth muscle actin that is involved in vascular contractility and blood pressure homeostasis. Mutations in this gene cause a variety of vascular diseases, such as thoracic aortic disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, and Moyamoya disease, as well as multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2017]
- Myl9: Myosin, a structural component of muscle, consists of two heavy chains and four light chains. The protein encoded by this gene is a myosin light chain that may regulate muscle contraction by modulating the ATPase activity of myosin heads. The encoded protein binds calcium and is activated by myosin light chain kinase. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Tpm2: This gene encodes beta-tropomyosin, a member of the actin filament binding protein family, and mainly expressed in slow, type 1 muscle fibers. Mutations in this gene can alter the expression of other sarcomeric tropomyosin proteins, and cause cap disease, nemaline myopathy and distal arthrogryposis syndromes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]
- Mustn1: Predicted to be involved in several processes, including chondrocyte differentiation; chondrocyte proliferation; and embryonic limb morphogenesis. Predicted to act upstream of or within positive regulation of chondrocyte differentiation; positive regulation of chondrocyte proliferation; and positive regulation of macromolecule metabolic process. Predicted to be located in nucleoplasm. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Igfbp7: This gene encodes a member of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP) family. IGFBPs bind IGFs with high affinity, and regulate IGF availability in body fluids and tissues and modulate IGF binding to its receptors. This protein binds IGF-I and IGF-II with relatively low affinity, and belongs to a subfamily of low-affinity IGFBPs. It also stimulates prostacyclin production and cell adhesion. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene, and one variant has been associated with retinal arterial macroaneurysm (PMID:21835307). [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]
- Tpm1: This gene is a member of the tropomyosin family of highly conserved, widely distributed actin-binding proteins involved in the contractile system of striated and smooth muscles and the cytoskeleton of non-muscle cells. Tropomyosin is composed of two alpha-helical chains arranged as a coiled-coil. It is polymerized end to end along the two grooves of actin filaments and provides stability to the filaments. The encoded protein is one type of alpha helical chain that forms the predominant tropomyosin of striated muscle, where it also functions in association with the troponin complex to regulate the calcium-dependent interaction of actin and myosin during muscle contraction. In smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a range of isoforms have been described. Mutations in this gene are associated with type 3 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy 1Y. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2022]
- Myl6: Myosin is a hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein. It is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali light chains, and two phosphorylatable regulatory light chains. This gene encodes a myosin alkali light chain that is expressed in smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues. Genomic sequences representing several pseudogenes have been described and two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Cald1: This gene encodes a calmodulin- and actin-binding protein that plays an essential role in the regulation of smooth muscle and nonmuscle contraction. The conserved domain of this protein possesses the binding activities to Ca(2+)-calmodulin, actin, tropomyosin, myosin, and phospholipids. This protein is a potent inhibitor of the actin-tropomyosin activated myosin MgATPase, and serves as a mediating factor for Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle contraction. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Eln: This gene encodes a protein that is one of the two components of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers comprise part of the extracellular matrix and confer elasticity to organs and tissues including the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels. The encoded protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine and proline, which form mobile hydrophobic regions bounded by crosslinks between lysine residues. Degradation products of the encoded protein, known as elastin-derived peptides or elastokines, bind the elastin receptor complex and other receptors and stimulate migration and proliferation of monocytes and skin fibroblasts. Elastokines can also contribute to cancer progression. Deletions and mutations in this gene are associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
- Tagln: This gene encodes a shape change and transformation sensitive actin-binding protein which belongs to the calponin family. It is ubiquitously expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and is an early marker of smooth muscle differentiation. The encoded protein is thought to be involved in calcium-independent smooth muscle contraction. It acts as a tumor suppressor, and the loss of its expression is an early event in cell transformation and the development of some tumors, coinciding with cellular plasticity. The encoded protein has a domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain and a C-terminal calponin-like (CLIK) domain. Mice with a knockout of the orthologous gene are viable and fertile but their vascular smooth muscle cells exhibit alterations in the distribution of the actin filament and changes in cytoskeletal organization.

Okay, I need to figure out the top 3 cell types for mouse cells based on the given markers. Let me start by looking at each gene and what cell types they are associated with.

First, Acta2 is a smooth muscle actin. That's a big hint for smooth muscle cells. Then Myl9 is a myosin light chain involved in muscle contraction, which also points to smooth muscle. Tpm2 is beta-tropomyosin, found in slow muscle fibers, so maybe skeletal or smooth muscle. Mustn1 is involved in chondrocyte processes, so cartilage cells like chondrocytes. Igfbp7 is an IGF-binding protein, which can be associated with various cells, maybe endothelial or fibroblasts. Tpm1 is another tropomyosin, similar to Tpm2, so again muscle. Myl6 is a myosin light chain in smooth and non-muscle tissues. Cald1 is a calmodulin-binding protein in smooth muscle. Eln is elastin, found in elastic fibers, so maybe smooth muscle or fibroblasts. Tagln is a smooth muscle marker, like calponin.

Putting this together, the strongest markers are Acta2, Myl9, Cald1, Tagln, Tpm1, and Tpm2. These are all highly expressed in smooth muscle cells. So smooth muscle cell is probably first. Then Mustn1 is involved in chondrocytes, but the other genes aren't typical for chondrocytes. However, maybe there's a mix. Elastin (Eln) is also in fibroblasts and vascular cells. Igfbp7 can be in endothelial cells or fibroblasts. So maybe fibroblasts are another possibility. Then, considering the muscle-related genes, maybe skeletal muscle is third? But Tpm2 is in slow muscle fibers. Alternatively, vascular smooth muscle cells could be a subtype. But the question asks for cell types, not subtypes. 

Wait, but Acta2 is also found in myofibroblasts. So maybe smooth muscle cells first, then myofibroblasts? But the presence of multiple smooth muscle markers like Tagln, Cald1, Myl9 makes me think smooth muscle is the top. Then, since Mustn1 is linked to chondrocytes, maybe cartilage cells are another. But the majority of markers are muscle-related. Eln could be in elastic tissues, so maybe fibroblasts or vascular cells. Let me check:

Smooth muscle cells: Acta2, Myl9, Tpm2 (beta-tropo), Cald1, Tagln, Myl6, Tpm1. That's a lot. So smooth muscle is definitely first. Then, maybe fibroblasts, as they can express Acta2 (myofibroblasts) and Eln. Fibroblasts also might have Igfbp7. Third, chondrocytes due to Mustn1, but that's only one gene. Alternatively, maybe skeletal muscle? Tpm2 is in type 1 fibers, and Tpm1 is in striated muscle. Myl6 is in smooth and non-muscle, but Myl9 is smooth. Hmm. Maybe vascular smooth muscle cells, but that's a subset. Alternatively, pericytes? They have some smooth muscle markers. Alternatively, myoepithelial cells? But the strongest is smooth muscle. Then, maybe fibroblasts as second. Third, maybe pericytes or myofibroblasts. Alternatively, since Mustn1 is involved in chondrocyte differentiation, but the other markers don't support that. Maybe the third is another muscle type, like smooth, skeletal, cardiac. Wait, Tpm1 is in striated muscle (cardiac and skeletal). Acta2 is smooth, but Tpm1 is in striated. So maybe cardiac muscle? But Myl9 is smooth. Maybe mixed markers. This is confusing. Let me think again.

Top markers: Acta2 (smooth muscle), Myl9 (smooth muscle), Tpm2 (skeletal slow), Tpm1 (striated), Cald1 (smooth), Tagln (smooth), Eln (smooth/fibroblast), Mustn1 (chondrocyte), Igfbp7 (fibroblast/endothelial), Myl6 (smooth).

So the majority of markers point to smooth muscle cells. Then, perhaps fibroblasts because of Eln and Igfbp7. Third, maybe skeletal muscle cells because of Tpm2 and Tpm1. But Tpm1 is also in smooth muscle. Alternatively, myofibroblasts which have smooth muscle markers. Alternatively, vascular smooth muscle cells. But the question is about cell types. So the top three would be:

1. Smooth muscle cells
2. Fibroblasts (since they can express Acta2 when activated as myofibroblasts, along with Eln and Igfbp7)
3. Skeletal muscle cells (due to Tpm2 and Tpm1, but maybe not as strong)

Alternatively, maybe pericytes as third? They have some smooth muscle markers. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, chondrocytes due to Mustn1, but only one marker. The other genes don't support that. So maybe:

Smooth muscle cells, Fibroblasts, and Skeletal muscle cells. But I need to check the markers again. Tpm2 is specifically in slow muscle fibers, which are skeletal. Tpm1 is in both cardiac and skeletal. Acta2 is smooth. Since the markers include both smooth and skeletal, but more smooth. Maybe the third is myofibroblasts. But I think the answer expected is smooth muscle first, then fibroblasts, then maybe chondrocytes or skeletal muscle. The presence of Mustn1 is for chondrocytes. Maybe the user expects that. Let me check the Mustn1 gene: involved in chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. So if that's present, maybe the cell type is chondrocyte. But other markers don't support that. So maybe the top three are:

1. Smooth muscle cells
2. Myofibroblasts
3. Chondrocytes

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of Eln (elastin) is also in fibroblasts, so maybe fibroblasts. Let's see. Let me list the markers and their primary cell types:

Acta2: Smooth muscle, myofibroblasts
Myl9: Smooth muscle
Tpm2: Skeletal muscle (slow)
Mustn1: Chondrocytes
Igfbp7: Fibroblasts, endothelial cells
Tpm1: Striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac)
Myl6: Smooth muscle, non-muscle
Cald1: Smooth muscle
Eln: Smooth muscle, fibroblasts, elastic tissues
Tagln: Smooth muscle

So, combining these, the strongest is smooth muscle. Then, since Igfbp7 and Eln are in fibroblasts, maybe fibroblasts. Mustn1 in chondrocytes. Tpm2 and Tpm1 in skeletal. But how many markers point to each?

Smooth muscle: Acta2, Myl9, Myl6, Cald1, Tagln, Eln (maybe), Tpm1 (if in smooth, but Tpm1 is more striated. Wait, Tpm1 is in smooth muscle? Let me check the summary for Tpm1: "predominant tropomyosin of striated muscle" but also "in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, alternatively spliced variants". So Tpm1 has isoforms in smooth muscle. So Tpm1 is present in both. So maybe smooth muscle has Tpm1 as well. So smooth muscle has Acta2, Myl9, Tpm1 (some isoforms), Myl6, Cald1, Tagln, Eln. That's a lot. Then fibroblasts: Acta2 (myofibroblasts), Eln, Igfbp7. Maybe Mustn1 is not enough for chondrocytes. Skeletal muscle: Tpm2, Tpm1 (striated). So for skeletal muscle, there's Tpm2 and Tpm1. So possible.

Therefore, the top 3 cell types would be:

1. Smooth muscle cells
2. Fibroblasts (myofibroblasts)
3. Skeletal muscle cells

But maybe chondrocytes if Mustn1 is considered. But with only one marker, it's less likely. Alternatively, vascular endothelial cells? Igfbp7 is sometimes there. But not sure. Alternatively, considering the markers, maybe the third is pericytes, which express some smooth muscle markers. But the user wants the top 3 based on the markers provided. So I think the answer is smooth muscle, fibroblasts, skeletal muscle. Alternatively, if Tpm2 is more specific to skeletal, then skeletal muscle would be third. But with more smooth muscle markers, maybe the third is another type. Alternatively, the presence of Elastin (Eln) and Igfbp7 might point to vascular smooth muscle or fibroblasts. Let me check again.

Acta2: Smooth muscle, myofibroblasts
Myl9: Smooth muscle
Tpm2: Skeletal (slow)
Mustn1: Chondrocytes
Igfbp7: Fibroblast, endothelial
Tpm1: Striated (skeletal, cardiac) and smooth (isoforms)
Myl6: Smooth
Cald1: Smooth
Eln: Smooth, fibroblasts, vascular
Tagln: Smooth

So smooth muscle has 7 markers. Fibroblasts have Acta2 (if myofibroblast), Igfbp7, Eln. Skeletal has Tpm2 and Tpm1. So smooth muscle is first. Fibroblasts second. Skeletal muscle third. But Mustn1 is chondrocyte, but only one. So maybe the third is skeletal muscle. So the answer is:

Smooth Muscle Cells, Fibroblasts, Skeletal Muscle Cells

Alternatively, if the user thinks that Mustn1 is significant enough, but with only one marker, it's less likely. So I think the top 3 are Smooth Muscle Cells, Fibroblasts, Skeletal Muscle Cells. But I need to confirm. Another approach: look up marker genes for cell types.

Smooth muscle cells: Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Cald1, Tpm1 (some isoforms), Myl6.

Fibroblasts: Eln, Igfbp7, Acta2 (if activated).

Skeletal muscle: Tpm2, Tpm1 (striated isoform).

So yes, that seems to fit. Therefore, the answer should be:

Smooth Muscle Cells, Fibroblasts, Skeletal Muscle Cells
