Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Ttr: This gene encodes one of the three prealbumins, which include alpha-1-antitrypsin, transthyretin and orosomucoid. The encoded protein, transthyretin, is a homo-tetrameric carrier protein, which transports thyroid hormones in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It is also involved in the transport of retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma by associating with retinol-binding protein. The protein may also be involved in other intracellular processes including proteolysis, nerve regeneration, autophagy and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with amyloid deposition, predominantly affecting peripheral nerves or the heart, while a small percentage of the gene mutations are non-amyloidogenic. The mutations are implicated in the etiology of several diseases, including amyloidotic polyneuropathy, euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia, amyloidotic vitreous opacities, cardiomyopathy, oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis, meningocerebrovascular amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

- 1500015O10Rik: Gene ID not found
- Sostdc1: This gene is a member of the sclerostin family and encodes an N-glycosylated, secreted protein with a C-terminal cystine knot-like domain. This protein functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. Specifically, it directly associates with BMPs, prohibiting them from binding their receptors, thereby regulating BMP signaling during cellular proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Kcnj13: This gene encodes a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family of proteins. Members of this family form ion channel pores that allow potassium ions to pass into a cell. The encoded protein belongs to a subfamily of low signal channel conductance proteins that have a low dependence on potassium concentration. Mutations in this gene are associated with snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010]
- Defb11: Defensins form a family of antimicrobial and cytotoxic peptides made by neutrophils. Defensins are short, processed peptide molecules that are classified by structure into three groups: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and theta-defensins. All beta-defensin genes are densely clustered in four to five syntenic chromosomal regions. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]
- Kcne2: Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, isk-related subfamily. This member is a small integral membrane subunit that assembles with the KCNH2 gene product, a pore-forming protein, to alter its function. This gene is expressed in heart and muscle and the gene mutations are associated with cardiac arrhythmia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Igfbp2: The protein encoded by this gene is one of six similar proteins that bind insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II). The encoded protein can be secreted into the bloodstream, where it binds IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity, or it can remain intracellular, interacting with many different ligands. High expression levels of this protein promote the growth of several types of tumors and may be predictive of the chances of recovery of the patient. Several transcript variants, one encoding a secreted isoform and the others encoding nonsecreted isoforms, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
- Trpm3: The product of this gene belongs to the family of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRP channels are cation-selective channels important for cellular calcium signaling and homeostasis. The protein encoded by this gene mediates calcium entry, and this entry is potentiated by calcium store depletion. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Slc6a15: This gene encodes a member of the solute carrier family 6 protein family which transports neutral amino acids. The encoded protein is thought to play a role in neuronal amino acid transport (PMID: 16185194) and may be associated with major depression (PMID: 21521612). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]
- Folr1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the folate receptor family. Members of this gene family bind folic acid and its reduced derivatives, and transport 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into cells. This gene product is a secreted protein that either anchors to membranes via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage or exists in a soluble form. Mutations in this gene have been associated with neurodegeneration due to cerebral folate transport deficiency. Due to the presence of two promoters, multiple transcription start sites, and alternative splicing, multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Ttr, 1500015O10Rik (which isn't found), Sostdc1, Kcnj13, Defb11, Kcne2, Igfbp2, Trpm3, Slc6a15, and Folr1. I'll need to go through each gene, recall their associated cell types, and see which ones are most prominent.

Starting with Ttr (Transthyretin). I remember that Ttr is a classic marker for choroid plexus epithelial cells. The choroid plexus produces cerebrospinal fluid, and Transthyretin is involved in transporting thyroid hormones there. So that's a strong indicator for choroid plexus.

Next, Sostdc1. This gene encodes a BMP antagonist. BMP signaling is important in various developmental processes. Sostdc1 is known to be expressed in the kidney, particularly in the nephron progenitors and may be involved in tooth development as well. It's also associated with certain stromal cells or mesenchymal cells.

Kcnj13 is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Potassium channels are crucial in many cells, but Kcnj13 is specifically linked to retinal cells. Mutations here cause vitreoretinal degeneration, so this might point to retinal cells or related eye tissues.

Defb11 is a beta-defensin, which are antimicrobial peptides. Defensins are often produced by epithelial cells, especially in the skin, lung, or gastrointestinal tract. They're also found in immune cells, but Defb11 might be more specific to certain epithelial surfaces.

Kcne2 is a potassium channel subunit. It's known to be expressed in the heart, particularly in the ventricles, and in the stomach. Mutations here are linked to cardiac arrhythmias, so cardiac muscle cells or gastric parietal cells might be relevant.

Igfbp2 is Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2. This is often associated with liver cells (hepatocytes) as they produce various binding proteins. It's also found in certain cancers and might be involved in osteoblast regulation, but liver is a strong candidate.

Trpm3 is a transient receptor potential channel involved in calcium signaling. It's expressed in sensory neurons, pancreatic beta cells, and possibly in the kidney. This could indicate neuronal or endocrine cell types.

Slc6a15 is a neutral amino acid transporter. It's found in the brain, particularly in neurons, and has been linked to depression. Neuronal cells in specific brain regions might express this.

Folr1 is the folate receptor 1. This receptor is highly expressed in epithelial cells of the kidneys, choroid plexus, and placenta. It's involved in folate transport, so cells that require high folate uptake, like certain epithelial cells, would have this.

Now, putting this together. Ttr and Folr1 both point towards choroid plexus epithelial cells. Folr1 is also in kidney, but combined with Ttr, choroid plexus seems more likely. Sostdc1's association with kidney and stromal cells might suggest kidney cells, but maybe more specifically renal tubular cells or nephron progenitors. Kcnj13's link to retinal cells suggests retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors. However, since the user is asking for the top 3, I need to see which markers are most specific and commonly associated with particular cell types.

Ttr is very specific for choroid plexus. Folr1 can be there too, reinforcing that. Sostdc1 in kidney. Kcnj13 in retina. Defb11 in epithelial surfaces. Igfbp2 in liver. Kcne2 in heart. So the top three would likely be:

1. Choroid plexus epithelial cells (Ttr, Folr1)
2. Renal tubular epithelial cells or kidney cells (Sostdc1, Folr1)
3. Retinal pigment epithelial cells (Kcnj13)

Alternatively, maybe pancreatic beta cells due to Trpm3, but that's less supported. Or liver hepatocytes with Igfbp2. But considering the combination and specificity, choroid plexus, kidney, and retinal cells seem more likely. Another thought: Defb11 could point to Paneth cells in the intestine, which produce defensins. But I'm not sure if Defb11 is specific to Paneth cells in mice. Similarly, Kcne2 in heart cells might indicate cardiac myocytes.

But given the markers, the strongest associations are Ttr and Folr1 for choroid plexus, Sostdc1 for kidney, and Kcnj13 for retinal. So the top three would be Choroid Plexus Epithelial Cells, Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells, and Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells. Alternatively, maybe Hepatocytes come in if Igfbp2 is a major marker there. I need to check which markers are more definitive.

Wait, Igfbp2: Liver hepatocytes do express Igfbp2, but so do other cells. But if Ttr and Folr1 are both in choroid plexus, that's two markers for that. Sostdc1 in kidney. Then maybe the ranking is:

1. Choroid Plexus Epithelial Cells
2. Renal Proximal Tubule Cells (Sostdc1, Folr1)
3. Retinal Pigment Epithelium (Kcnj13)

Alternatively, the third could be Pancreatic Beta Cells (Trpm3), but I think retinal is more supported. So the answer would be those three. Let me confirm each marker's primary cell types.

Ttr: Definitely choroid plexus, also liver, but mainly choroid plexus.

Folr1: Choroid plexus, kidney proximal tubule, placenta.

Sostdc1: Kidney development, tooth, bone.

Kcnj13: Retina.

Defb11: Possibly intestinal Paneth cells or other epithelial defensins.

Igfbp2: Liver, but also adipose tissue, osteoblasts.

Kcne2: Heart, stomach.

Trpm3: Sensory neurons, pancreatic beta cells.

Slc6a15: Neurons in brain.

So combining these, the strongest are:

1. Choroid plexus epithelial cells (Ttr, Folr1)
2. Kidney proximal tubular cells (Folr1, Sostdc1)
3. Retinal pigment epithelial cells (Kcnj13)

Alternatively, if Defb11 is a major marker for Paneth cells, then maybe intestinal Paneth cells could be third. But Kcnj13 is more specific to retina.

Another angle: Folr1 in kidney proximal tubule is a known marker. Sostdc1 is expressed in kidney stroma and nephron progenitors. So maybe kidney proximal tubule is a good candidate. Retinal cells with Kcnj13. So the top three are:

Choroid Plexus Epithelial Cells, Kidney Proximal Tubule Cells, Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.

Yes, that seems right.

Choroid Plexus Epithelial Cells, Renal Proximal Tubule Cells, Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells
