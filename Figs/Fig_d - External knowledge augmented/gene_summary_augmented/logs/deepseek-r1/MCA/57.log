Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Sprr2f: Predicted to be involved in keratinization. Predicted to act upstream of or within response to estradiol. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm and nucleus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Fam213a: Enables antioxidant activity. Involved in regulation of osteoclast differentiation. Located in cytoplasm. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Padi1: This gene encodes a member of the peptidyl arginine deiminase family of enzymes, which catalyze the post-translational deimination of proteins by converting arginine residues into citrullines in the presence of calcium ions. The family members have distinct substrate specificities and tissue-specific expression patterns. The type I enzyme is involved in the late stages of epidermal differentiation, where it deiminates filaggrin and keratin K1, which maintains hydration of the stratum corneum, and hence the cutaneous barrier function. This enzyme may also play a role in hair follicle formation. This gene exists in a cluster with four other paralogous genes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Fxyd4: This gene encodes a member of a family of small membrane proteins that share a 35-amino acid signature sequence domain, beginning with the sequence PFXYD and containing 7 invariant and 6 highly conserved amino acids. The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. FXYD4, originally named CHIF for channel-inducing factor, has been shown to modulate the properties of the Na,K-ATPase, as has FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and FXYD7. Transmembrane topology has been established for FXYD4 and two family members (FXYD1 and FXYD2), with the N-terminus extracellular and the C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010]
- Tmem213: Predicted to be integral component of membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ltf: This gene is a member of the transferrin family of genes and its protein product is found in the secondary granules of neutrophils. The protein is a major iron-binding protein in milk and body secretions with an antimicrobial activity, making it an important component of the non-specific immune system. The protein demonstrates a broad spectrum of properties, including regulation of iron homeostasis, host defense against a broad range of microbial infections, anti-inflammatory activity, regulation of cellular growth and differentiation and protection against cancer development and metastasis. Antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic activity has been found for this protein and its peptides. Activity against both DNA and RNA viruses has been found, including activity against SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2021]
- Spink12: Gene ID not found
- Lcn2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
- Clca1: This gene encodes a member of the calcium sensitive chloride conductance protein family. To date, all members of this gene family map to the same region on chromosome 1p31-p22 and share a high degree of homology in size, sequence, and predicted structure, but differ significantly in their tissue distributions. The encoded protein is expressed as a precursor protein that is processed into two cell-surface-associated subunits, although the site at which the precursor is cleaved has not been precisely determined. The encoded protein may be involved in mediating calcium-activated chloride conductance in the intestine. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Wfdc2: This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the WFDC domain family. The WFDC domain, or WAP Signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor in many family members. This gene is expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, and was also found to be expressed in some ovarian cancers. The encoded protein is a small secretory protein, which may be involved in sperm maturation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given markers. I need to go through each gene, recall their associated cell types, and then see which ones are most common or prominent.

Starting with Sprr2f. I remember that SPRR genes are involved in keratinization. They are often found in epithelial cells, specifically in the skin. So maybe epidermal cells or keratinocytes?

Fam213a has antioxidant activity and is involved in osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts are related to bone, so maybe bone cells. But Fam213a (also known as peroxiredoxin 4?) might be in osteoclasts or cells involved in bone resorption.

Padi1 is a peptidyl arginine deiminase. From the description, it's involved in epidermal differentiation, deiminating filaggrin and keratin K1. That's definitely skin-related, so again keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. So Padi1 is a strong marker for skin epithelial cells, maybe specifically for terminally differentiated keratinocytes.

Fxyd4 modulates Na,K-ATPase. This is found in kidney cells, as ion transport regulation is crucial there. So maybe renal tubular cells or kidney epithelial cells?

Tmem213 is a transmembrane protein, but not much info. Maybe not a strong marker. Could be present in various cells but not specific.

Ltf is lactotransferrin, found in neutrophils. Lcn2 is lipocalin 2, also associated with neutrophils and innate immunity. So both Ltf and Lcn2 are markers for neutrophils. That's a strong indication. So maybe neutrophils are one of the top cell types here.

Clca1 is calcium-activated chloride channel, expressed in the intestine. So goblet cells or intestinal epithelial cells? Clca1 is linked to mucus secretion, so goblet cells perhaps.

Wfdc2 is a WFDC domain protein, expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells and ovarian cancers. Also involved in sperm maturation. Maybe respiratory epithelial cells or certain secretory cells.

Spink12 wasn't found, so probably irrelevant here.

Putting this all together: the markers include genes for skin (Sprr2f, Padi1), neutrophils (Ltf, Lcn2), and intestinal/goblet cells (Clca1). There's also kidney (Fxyd4) and others, but the strongest seem to be keratinocytes, neutrophils, and maybe goblet cells.

Wait, but Padi1 is specifically for epidermal differentiation. So combining Sprr2f and Padi1, that's two markers for keratinocytes. Then Ltf and Lcn2 for neutrophils. Clca1 for goblet cells. So the top three would be:

1. Keratinocytes (due to Sprr2f and Padi1)
2. Neutrophils (Ltf, Lcn2)
3. Goblet cells (Clca1)

Alternatively, could also consider other epithelial cells, but the combination of two skin markers makes keratinocytes the top. Neutrophils have two markers. Then Clca1 is a single but specific marker for goblet cells. Wfdc2 might point to pulmonary or secretory cells, but with only one marker, maybe lower priority. So the top three are likely Keratinocytes, Neutrophils, and Goblet Cells.
