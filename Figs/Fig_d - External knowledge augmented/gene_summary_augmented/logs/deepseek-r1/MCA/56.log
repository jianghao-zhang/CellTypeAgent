Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Atp6v1g3: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme that mediates acidification of eukaryotic intracellular organelles. V-ATPase dependent organelle acidification is necessary for such intracellular processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists of five different subunits: a, c, c', c'' and d. Additional isoforms of many of the V1 and V0 subunit proteins are encoded by multiple genes or alternatively spliced transcript variants. This gene encodes one of three G subunit proteins. Transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

- Rhcg: Enables ammonium transmembrane transporter activity; ankyrin binding activity; and identical protein binding activity. Involved in ammonium transmembrane transport; cellular ion homeostasis; and transepithelial ammonium transport. Located in apical plasma membrane and basolateral plasma membrane. Is integral component of plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Atp6v0d2: Predicted to enable proton transmembrane transporter activity. Predicted to be involved in vacuolar acidification and vacuolar transport. Located in apical plasma membrane. Part of vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Clcnkb: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the family of voltage-gated chloride channels. Chloride channels have several functions, including the regulation of cell volume, membrane potential stabilization, signal transduction and transepithelial transport. This gene is expressed predominantly in the kidney and may be important for renal salt reabsorption. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive Bartter syndrome type 3 (BS3). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers provided are Atp6v1g3, Tmem213, Atp6v1a, mt-Nd5, Spink8, Car12, Atp6v1b1, Rhcg, Atp6v0d2, Clcnkb.

First, I need to look at each of these genes and see what cell types they are associated with. Let's go through them one by one.

Starting with Atp6v1g3. From the NCBI summary, this is a subunit of V-ATPase, which is involved in acidifying organelles. V-ATPases are found in various cells, but I remember that in the kidney, certain subunits are specific. For example, intercalated cells in the kidney are known for high V-ATPase activity. Similarly, Atp6v1a is another V-ATPase subunit. Atp6v1b1 is mentioned in the context of kidney and mutations causing renal tubular acidosis with deafness. So these three (Atp6v1g3, Atp6v1a, Atp6v1b1) might point towards kidney cells, specifically intercalated cells.

Then there's Rhcg. The summary says it's involved in ammonium transport and located in plasma membranes. Rhcg is also known to be expressed in kidney cells, particularly in collecting duct cells, which again points to the kidney. Clcnkb is a chloride channel linked to Bartter syndrome type 3, which affects kidney function. So Clcnkb is another kidney-related gene, possibly in the thick ascending limb of Henle.

Atp6v0d2 is part of the V-ATPase complex as well. This subunit might be found in osteoclasts, which use V-ATPase to acidify the resorption lacuna. But some V-ATPase subunits are tissue-specific. However, given the other kidney markers, maybe this is also in the kidney. Alternatively, intercalated cells in the kidney also use V-ATPase, so maybe it's part of that.

mt-Nd5 is a mitochondrial gene involved in electron transport chain complex I. High mitochondrial content is typical in cells with high energy demands, like proximal tubule cells in the kidney or muscle cells. But considering the other markers, kidney is more likely.

Tmem213 is a transmembrane protein, but the description is vague. Spink8 is a serine protease inhibitor, which might be in secretory cells, maybe in certain epithelial cells. Car12 wasn't found, but maybe it's a typo? CAR12 is Carbonic Anhydrase 12, which is involved in pH regulation and expressed in kidney and other tissues.

Putting this all together, the majority of these markers are linked to kidney function. Intercalated cells in the collecting duct are rich in V-ATPases (Atp6v1g3, Atp6v1a, Atp6v1b1, Atp6v0d2), Rhcg (ammonium transport), Clcnkb (chloride channel in kidney). The presence of multiple V-ATPase subunits strongly suggests intercalated cells. Then, Clcnkb is associated with the thick ascending limb (Bartter syndrome), so maybe thick ascending limb cells. Another possibility is proximal tubule cells, but they might have different markers. Alternatively, principal cells in the collecting duct, but they usually have aquaporins.

Alternatively, some of these V-ATPases are found in osteoclasts, but without specific osteoclast markers like Acp5 (TRAP), it's less likely. Another thought: Atp6v1b1 is specifically in the kidney, so combining that with Clcnkb and Rhcg, the top cell types are likely different kidney epithelial cells.

So the top three cell types could be: 1. Renal intercalated cells (due to V-ATPases and Rhcg), 2. Thick ascending limb cells (Clcnkb), 3. Proximal tubule cells (maybe Car12 if it's CA12, which is in proximal tubule). Alternatively, maybe collecting duct principal cells, but not sure. Alternatively, other kidney cells.

Alternatively, some of these might be in other tissues, but given the combination, kidney is dominant. So ranking the top 3 as intercalated cells, thick ascending limb cells, and proximal tubule cells. Or perhaps intercalated cells, then maybe distal convoluted tubule, but I need to check which markers correspond where.

Wait, Clcnkb mutations cause Bartter syndrome type 3, which affects the thick ascending limb. So Clcnkb is a marker for thick ascending limb. Rhcg is in collecting duct intercalated cells. Atp6v1b1 is in intercalated cells. So first would be intercalated cells (collecting duct), then thick ascending limb cells, then maybe proximal tubule. Alternatively, maybe distal convoluted tubule? Or another part.

Alternatively, maybe intercalated cells (type A or B), thick ascending limb, and another kidney cell type. Alternatively, given that Atp6v0d2 is in osteoclasts, but that might be a stretch without more markers. The presence of multiple V-ATPases in kidney suggests intercalated cells as top, followed by thick ascending limb (Clcnkb), and then maybe proximal tubule if Car12 is CA12. So the top three cell types would be: 1. Kidney intercalated cells, 2. Kidney thick ascending limb cells, 3. Kidney proximal tubule cells.

Alternatively, maybe other cell types. But given the markers, the strongest evidence is for kidney cells, and the specific subunits point to intercalated cells first.
