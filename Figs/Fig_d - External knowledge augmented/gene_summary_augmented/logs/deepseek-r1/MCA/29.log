Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Igfbp7: This gene encodes a member of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP) family. IGFBPs bind IGFs with high affinity, and regulate IGF availability in body fluids and tissues and modulate IGF binding to its receptors. This protein binds IGF-I and IGF-II with relatively low affinity, and belongs to a subfamily of low-affinity IGFBPs. It also stimulates prostacyclin production and cell adhesion. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene, and one variant has been associated with retinal arterial macroaneurysm (PMID:21835307). [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]
- Mgp: This gene encodes a member of the osteocalcin/matrix Gla family of proteins. The encoded vitamin K-dependent protein is secreted by chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and functions as a physiological inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification. Carboxylation status of the encoded protein is associated with calcification of the vasculature in human patients with cardiovascular disease and calcification of the synovial membranes in osteoarthritis patients. Mutations in this gene cause Keutel syndrome in human patients, which is characterized by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis and facial hypoplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]
- Sparc: This gene encodes a cysteine-rich acidic matrix-associated protein. The encoded protein is required for the collagen in bone to become calcified but is also involved in extracellular matrix synthesis and promotion of changes to cell shape. The gene product has been associated with tumor suppression but has also been correlated with metastasis based on changes to cell shape which can promote tumor cell invasion. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2015]
- Tbx20: This gene encodes a T-box family member. The T-box family members share a common DNA binding domain, termed the T-box, and they are transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is essential for heart development. Mutations in this gene are associated with diverse cardiac pathologies, including defects in septation, valvulogenesis and cardiomyopathy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]
- Postn: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
- Slc16a2: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that functions as a transporter of thyroid hormone. The encoded protein facilitates the cellular importation of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and diidothyronine (T2). This gene is expressed in many tissues and likely plays an important role in the development of the central nervous system. Loss of function mutations in this gene are associated with psychomotor retardation in males while females exhibit no neurological defects and more moderate thyroid-deficient phenotypes. This gene is subject to X-chromosome inactivation. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]
- Myl2: This gene encodes a major sarcomeric protein in mammalian striated muscle. The encoded protein plays a role in embryonic heart muscle structure and function, while phosphorylation of the encoded protein is involved in cardiac myosin cycling kinetics, torsion and function in adults. Mutations in this gene are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 10 and infant-onset myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]
- Sln: Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases are transmembrane proteins that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. This gene encodes a small proteolipid that regulates several sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases. The transmembrane protein interacts with Ca(2+)-ATPases and reduces the accumulation of Ca(2+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum without affecting the rate of ATP hydrolysis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Myl3: MYL3 encodes myosin light chain 3, an alkali light chain also referred to in the literature as both the ventricular isoform and the slow skeletal muscle isoform. Mutations in MYL3 have been identified as a cause of mid-left ventricular chamber type hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Aspn: This gene encodes a cartilage extracellular protein that is member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family. The encoded protein may regulate chondrogenesis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta 1-induced gene expression in cartilage. This protein also binds collagen and calcium and may induce collagen mineralization. Polymorphisms in the aspartic acid repeat region of this gene are associated with a susceptibility to osteoarthritis, and also with intervertebral disc disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on these markers. First, I need to recall the function of each gene and which cell types they are associated with.

Starting with Igfbp7: It's part of the IGF-binding protein family. I remember that IGFBPs are involved in regulating growth factors. Some sources mention that Igfbp7 is expressed in endothelial cells or fibroblasts. Maybe vascular smooth muscle cells too?

Mgp: Matrix Gla protein. The summary says it's secreted by chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and it inhibits tissue calcification. So Mgp is a marker for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and chondrocytes. Keutel syndrome is linked to mutations here, which affects cartilage calcification. So Mgp points towards VSMCs or chondrocytes.

Sparc: Encodes a matrix-associated protein involved in collagen calcification, extracellular matrix synthesis. SPARC is often found in osteoblasts (bone cells) and fibroblasts. Also, some cancers, but since we're looking at normal mouse cells, maybe osteoblasts or fibroblasts.

Tbx20: A T-box transcription factor important in heart development. Mutations cause cardiac issues. So this is a marker for cardiomyocytes or other heart-related cells like cardiac progenitor cells.

Postn: Periostin. It's involved in extracellular matrix, wound healing, and cardiac remodeling. Periostin is expressed in fibroblasts, especially cardiac fibroblasts after injury. Also, in osteoblasts and some epithelial cells. But in the context of these markers, maybe cardiac fibroblasts or osteoblasts.

Slc16a2: Thyroid hormone transporter. Important in CNS development. Since it's a thyroid hormone transporter, maybe cells in the thyroid? But Slc16a2 is also expressed in neurons or glial cells. But I'm not sure. Maybe astrocytes or other neural cells? But this might not be a strong marker for the main cell types here.

Myl2: Myosin light chain 2. Specifically mentioned as a major sarcomeric protein in striated muscle. So this is a marker for cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) or skeletal muscle. Since Myl2 is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, likely cardiomyocytes.

Sln: Sarcolipin. Regulates calcium ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. So again, muscle cells. But maybe more specific to skeletal muscle? Or both?

Myl3: Myosin light chain 3, associated with ventricular isoform. So this is specific to cardiac muscle (ventricular cardiomyocytes) and slow skeletal muscle. So again, pointing towards cardiomyocytes.

Aspn: Asporin. Cartilage extracellular protein, part of proteoglycan family. Inhibits TGF-beta in cartilage. Associated with osteoarthritis. So Aspn is a marker for chondrocytes.

Putting this together:

Mgp and Aspn are both linked to chondrocytes (cartilage cells). Mgp is also in VSMCs, but Aspn is more specific to cartilage. So maybe chondrocytes are one.

Tbx20, Myl2, Myl3, Sln: All related to cardiac muscle. Tbx20 is crucial in heart development, Myl2 and Myl3 are myosin components in heart. Sln is in both cardiac and skeletal, but with the other markers, maybe cardiomyocytes.

Postn and Sparc: Postn is involved in cardiac fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Sparc is in osteoblasts and fibroblasts. If Postn and Sparc are both present, maybe fibroblasts, especially cardiac fibroblasts. But also, osteoblasts.

Igfbp7: Could be fibroblasts or endothelial cells. If other markers like Postn and Sparc are present, perhaps fibroblasts.

So possible cell types:

1. Cardiomyocytes (due to Tbx20, Myl2, Myl3, Sln)
2. Chondrocytes (Mgp, Aspn)
3. Fibroblasts (Igfbp7, Sparc, Postn)

Alternatively, maybe vascular smooth muscle cells from Mgp and others, but Mgp is also in chondrocytes. Since Aspn is specific to chondrocytes, that's more likely. So top three would be Cardiomyocytes, Chondrocytes, Fibroblasts. But need to check if any other combinations make sense.

Wait, Slc16a2 is thyroid hormone transporter. Maybe in some other cell type, but if the other markers are strong for muscle and cartilage, then maybe not. So the top three are probably:

1. Cardiomyocytes
2. Chondrocytes
3. Fibroblasts
