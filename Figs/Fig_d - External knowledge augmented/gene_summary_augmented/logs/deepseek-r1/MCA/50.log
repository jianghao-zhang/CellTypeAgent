Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Calb1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the calcium-binding protein superfamily that includes calmodulin and troponin C. Originally described as a 27 kDa protein, it is now known to be a 28 kDa protein. It contains four active calcium-binding domains, and has two modified domains that are thought to have lost their calcium binding capability. This protein is thought to buffer entry of calcium upon stimulation of glutamate receptors. Depletion of this protein was noted in patients with Huntington disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2015]
- Rprm: Predicted to be involved in regulation of mitotic cell cycle. Predicted to act upstream of or within regulation of cell cycle. Predicted to be integral component of membrane. Predicted to be active in cytoplasm. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Wfdc2: This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the WFDC domain family. The WFDC domain, or WAP Signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor in many family members. This gene is expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, and was also found to be expressed in some ovarian cancers. The encoded protein is a small secretory protein, which may be involved in sperm maturation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Wfdc15b: Gene ID not found
- Cldn6: Tight junctions represent one mode of cell-to-cell adhesion in epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, forming continuous seals around cells and serving as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space. These junctions are comprised of sets of continuous networking strands in the outwardly facing cytoplasmic leaflet, with complementary grooves in the inwardly facing extracytoplasmic leaflet. This gene encodes a component of tight junction strands, which is a member of the claudin family. The protein is an integral membrane protein and is one of the entry cofactors for hepatitis C virus. The gene methylation may be involved in esophageal tumorigenesis. This gene is adjacent to another family member CLDN9 on chromosome 16.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
- Mdk: This gene encodes a member of a small family of secreted growth factors that binds heparin and responds to retinoic acid. The encoded protein promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, in particular during tumorigenesis. This gene has been targeted as a therapeutic for a variety of different disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]
- Hoxb7: This gene is a member of the Antp homeobox family and encodes a protein with a homeobox DNA-binding domain. It is included in a cluster of homeobox B genes located on chromosome 17. The encoded nuclear protein functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor that is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Increased expression of this gene is associated with some cases of melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Cldn7: This gene encodes a member of the claudin family. Claudins are integral membrane proteins and components of tight junction strands. Tight junction strands serve as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space between epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, and also play critical roles in maintaining cell polarity and signal transductions. Differential expression of this gene has been observed in different types of malignancies, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, urinary tumors, prostate cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancers, thyroid carcinomas, etc.. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010]
- Ldhb: This gene encodes the B subunit of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+ in a post-glycolysis process. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Recent studies have shown that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Mutations in this gene are associated with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X, 5 and 13. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]
- Ptma: Enables DNA-binding transcription factor binding activity. Involved in negative regulation of apoptotic process. Located in cytosol and nucleoplasm. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. Let's start by going through each gene and their associated cell types.

Calb1 is a calcium-binding protein. I remember that Calbindin (Calb1) is often found in neurons, like in the cerebellum, and also in certain endocrine cells, such as pancreatic beta cells. Maybe neurons or endocrine cells?

Rprm is involved in cell cycle regulation. Not sure about this one. Maybe proliferating cells or stem cells? But I need more info.

Wfdc2 is a protease inhibitor expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells and ovarian cancers. Wfdc2 is also known as HE4, which is a marker for ovarian cancer, but in normal tissues, it's found in epithelial cells of the respiratory and reproductive tracts. So maybe epithelial cells, like lung or ovarian surface epithelial cells?

Wfdc15b wasn't found in the database. Maybe it's a less common marker or a pseudogene. Might not contribute much.

Cldn6 is a claudin family member involved in tight junctions. Claudins are typically in epithelial cells. Cldn6 might be specific to certain epithelial layers. For example, in the epidermis or specific glandular epithelia.

Mdk (midkine) is a growth factor involved in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. It's expressed in various tissues during development and in certain cancers. Maybe endothelial cells or some stem/progenitor cells?

Hoxb7 is a homeobox gene involved in development. Hox genes are important in body patterning. Hoxb7 is associated with certain cancers, like melanoma and ovarian. Maybe cells from the nervous system or epithelial cells in specific regions?

Cldn7 is another claudin, involved in tight junctions. Expressed in epithelial cells, especially in tissues like the kidney, intestine, etc. Mutations or changes in expression are linked to various cancers. So another epithelial marker.

Ldhb is part of lactate dehydrogenase. Ldhb is more common in tissues with aerobic metabolism. For example, heart muscle (LDH-H subunit) uses Ldhb, so maybe cardiomyocytes or other muscle cells? But Ldhb is also present in other tissues.

Ptma is prothymosin alpha, involved in apoptosis regulation and cell proliferation. Found in many cells, especially those with high proliferation rates, like immune cells or stem cells. But not sure about specificity.

Putting this together: The presence of multiple claudins (Cldn6, Cldn7) suggests epithelial cells. Wfdc2 (HE4) points towards certain epithelial cells, maybe in the lung or ovary. Calb1 could be in epithelial cells as well (e.g., kidney or pancreatic islets). Mdk might be in endothelial cells or epithelial. Hoxb7 could be in developing epithelial or neural cells. Ldhb's presence might indicate a cell type with active metabolism, but maybe part of a tissue with epithelial origin.

So the strongest markers here are the claudins (Cldn6 and Cldn7) and Wfdc2. Claudins are tight junction proteins, so epithelial cells are a given. Wfdc2 is in pulmonary and ovarian epithelial cells. Calb1 in certain epithelial cells (like kidney or pancreatic). Maybe the top cell types are:

1. Epithelial cells (lung or ovarian surface)
2. Renal tubular epithelial cells (since Calb1 is in kidney)
3. Endothelial cells (but Mdk is also in angiogenesis, but claudins are more epithelial)

Wait, but endothelial cells don't typically express claudins as much as epithelial. So maybe specific epithelial subtypes. Alternatively, intestinal epithelial cells? But Cldn6 and 7 are in various epithelia. Let me check: Wfdc2 is in pulmonary, so maybe lung epithelial cells. Calb1 in pancreatic beta cells. But if multiple claudins are present, perhaps a glandular epithelial cell type. Alternatively, ovarian surface epithelial cells (due to Wfdc2). Maybe the top three are:

1. Pulmonary epithelial cells (due to Wfdc2 and claudins)
2. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2, claudins)
3. Renal tubular epithelial cells (Calb1, claudins)

Alternatively, maybe intestinal epithelial cells. But I need to think about other markers. Mdk is sometimes in endothelial, but also in epithelial during development. Hoxb7 is in some cancers and development. Ptma is general. Ldhb is in tissues with aerobic metabolism. Rprm is cell cycle, so maybe proliferating epithelial cells?

Another angle: Wfdc2 and Cldn6/7 are markers for certain carcinomas. But in normal tissues, Wfdc2 is in lung and ovary. Calb1 in neurons and endocrine cells. If all these markers are in the same cell type, perhaps a secretory epithelial cell type. Maybe Clara cells in the lung (which are epithelial and secretory), or ovarian epithelial cells. Alternatively, kidney epithelial cells (Calb1 is in distal tubules). So possible top 3:

1. Lung epithelial cells (Clara cells or alveolar type II)
2. Ovarian surface epithelial cells
3. Renal tubular epithelial cells

Alternatively, pancreatic islet cells (Calb1 is in beta cells), but then why the claudins and Wfdc2? Claudins are more in exocrine pancreas. Hmm. Maybe the combination suggests a different cell type. Let me think again.

Wait, Mdk is also expressed in some neurons. But with claudins, that's conflicting. So maybe the presence of both epithelial and neuronal markers? Unlikely. Probably the main markers are the claudins and Wfdc2 pointing to epithelial. Calb1 could be in epithelial cells (like kidney), so maybe renal proximal tubule or distal tubule. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Cldn6/7)
2. Pulmonary epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Cldn6/7)
3. Renal tubular epithelial cells (Calb1, Cldn6/7)

Alternatively, maybe a glandular epithelial cell from another organ. But without more specific markers, these are the likely candidates. So the answer would be those three, ordered based on the strength of the markers. Wfdc2 is strongly associated with ovarian and pulmonary, so maybe ovarian first, then lung, then kidney. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering multiple claudins and Wfdc2, maybe lung is more likely. Alternatively, maybe endometrial epithelial cells? Not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking up cell markers: Calb1 is in kidney, neurons, pancreatic beta cells. Cldn6 is in embryonic tissues, certain epithelia. Cldn7 is in many epithelia. Wfdc2 is in lung and ovary. Mdk in various. Hoxb7 in some cancers. So combining, the top cell types might be:

1. Ovarian surface epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Cldn6/7)
2. Lung epithelial cells (Wfdc2, Cldn6/7)
3. Renal tubular epithelial cells (Calb1, Cldn7)

But I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is that Calb1 in combination with Cldn6/7 and Wfdc2 could indicate a secretory epithelial cell type in the female reproductive tract, like fallopian tube epithelial cells. Alternatively, endometrial cells. But without more specific markers, it's challenging. 

Another thought: Cldn6 and Cldn7 are found in tight junctions of various epithelia, including the epidermis. But Wfdc2's presence in lung and ovary might tip towards those organs. 

Given the information, the most probable cell types are likely epithelial cells from ovary, lung, and kidney. So the answer would be Ovarian surface epithelial cells, Pulmonary epithelial cells, Renal tubular epithelial cells, separated by commas.
