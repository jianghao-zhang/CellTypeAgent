Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Atp1a2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type cation transport ATPases, and to the subfamily of Na+/K+ -ATPases. Na+/K+ -ATPase is an integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane. These gradients are essential for osmoregulation, for sodium-coupled transport of a variety of organic and inorganic molecules, and for electrical excitability of nerve and muscle. This enzyme is composed of two subunits, a large catalytic subunit (alpha) and a smaller glycoprotein subunit (beta). The catalytic subunit of Na+/K+ -ATPase is encoded by multiple genes. This gene encodes an alpha 2 subunit. Mutations in this gene result in familial basilar or hemiplegic migraines, and in a rare syndrome known as alternating hemiplegia of childhood.

- Aldoc: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-biphosphate aldolase gene family. Expressed specifically in the hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the brain, the encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of fructose-1,6-biphosphate and fructose 1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or glyceraldehyde, respectively. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gpr37l1: Enables G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity; peptide binding activity; and prosaposin receptor activity. Involved in adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and positive regulation of MAPK cascade. Located in plasma membrane. Part of receptor complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Atp1b2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPases beta chain proteins, and to the subfamily of Na+/K+ -ATPases. Na+/K+ -ATPase is an integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane. These gradients are essential for osmoregulation, for sodium-coupled transport of a variety of organic and inorganic molecules, and for electrical excitability of nerve and muscle. This enzyme is composed of two subunits, a large catalytic subunit (alpha) and a smaller glycoprotein subunit (beta). The beta subunit regulates, through assembly of alpha/beta heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported to the plasma membrane. The glycoprotein subunit of Na+/K+ -ATPase is encoded by multiple genes. This gene encodes a beta 2 subunit. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2014]
- Ntsr2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Binding and pharmacological studies demonstrate that this receptor binds neurotensin as well as several other ligands already described for neurotensin NT1 receptor. However, unlike NT1 receptor, this gene recognizes, with high affinity, levocabastine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist previously shown to compete with neurotensin for low-affinity binding sites in brain. These activities suggest that this receptor may be of physiological importance and that a natural agonist for the receptor may exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Slc1a3: This gene encodes a member of a member of a high affinity glutamate transporter family. This gene functions in the termination of excitatory neurotransmission in central nervous system. Mutations are associated with episodic ataxia, Type 6. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]
- Slc1a2: This gene encodes a member of a family of solute transporter proteins. The membrane-bound protein is the principal transporter that clears the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from the extracellular space at synapses in the central nervous system. Glutamate clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Improper regulation of this gene is thought to be associated with several neurological disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]
- Sparcl1: Predicted to enable calcium ion binding activity; collagen binding activity; and extracellular matrix binding activity. Predicted to be involved in anatomical structure development and regulation of synapse organization. Located in extracellular space. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Ndrg2: This gene is a member of the N-myc downregulated gene family which belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein that may play a role in neurite outgrowth. This gene may be involved in glioblastoma carcinogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
- Pla2g7: The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of platelet-activating factor to biologically inactive products. Defects in this gene are a cause of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase deficiency. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009]

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 cell types in mouse based on the given markers. The markers are Atp1a2, Aldoc, Gpr37l1, Atp1b2, Ntsr2, Slc1a3, Slc1a2, Sparcl1, Ndrg2, Pla2g7.

First, I'll go through each gene and recall which cell types they're associated with. 

Starting with Atp1a2. The description says it's part of the Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-2 subunit. I remember that Atp1a2 is a marker for astrocytes. Astrocytes often express this because they're involved in ion transport and maintaining the electrochemical gradient. 

Aldoc encodes aldolase C, which is specific to the cerebellum's Purkinje cells and the hippocampus. So Aldoc is a marker for Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. 

Gpr37l1. G protein-coupled receptors, specifically mentioned in the brain, maybe astrocytes or other glial cells. Some sources link Gpr37l1 to astrocytes or Bergmann glia. 

Atp1b2 is the beta-2 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase. Again, this is associated with astrocytes. The beta subunits help in the proper functioning of the sodium-potassium pump, so another astrocyte marker. 

Ntsr2 is the neurotensin receptor 2. This receptor is known to be expressed in astrocytes, particularly in certain regions of the brain. 

Slc1a3 and Slc1a2 are glutamate transporters. Slc1a3 is also known as GLAST, and Slc1a2 is GLT-1. Both are classic astrocyte markers involved in glutamate uptake from synapses. 

Sparcl1 (also called Hevin) is expressed in astrocytes and involved in extracellular matrix interactions. 

Ndrg2 is another gene expressed in astrocytes, involved in stress responses and differentiation. 

Pla2g7 is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. This is found in macrophages and some glial cells, but maybe also in astrocytes. 

Putting this together, most of these markers (Atp1a2, Atp1b2, Slc1a3, Slc1a2, Sparcl1, Ndrg2, Gpr37l1, Ntsr2) are strongly associated with astrocytes. So the primary cell type here is astrocytes. 

Aldoc is specific to Purkinje cells, which are a type of neuron in the cerebellum. Since Aldoc is present, Purkinje cells should be the second. 

Pla2g7 might be found in microglia or macrophages, but given the other markers are mostly astrocytic, maybe the third cell type is something else. Alternatively, given that some markers like Gpr37l1 might be in Bergmann glia (a subtype of astrocytes in the cerebellum), but since Purkinje cells are neurons, perhaps the third could be another glial cell type. Wait, but let me check again. 

Wait, Pla2g7 is also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. It's expressed in astrocytes in some contexts, but maybe more in macrophages. However, given the other markers, maybe oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) or another type? Or perhaps endothelial cells? Hmm. 

Alternatively, the presence of multiple astrocyte markers suggests that the top cell type is astrocytes. Then Aldoc points to Purkinje cells, which are neurons. But since there's a mix, maybe the cell type is a specific subtype of astrocyte. Alternatively, considering that some markers like Aldoc are specific to Purkinje cells, but if the cell has both Aldoc and astrocyte markers, that might not be possible. Wait, but in the problem statement, the markers are from a single cell? So if a cell expresses both Aldoc (Purkinje) and astrocyte markers, that's conflicting. But maybe the markers are from a dataset where multiple cells are present, but the task is to find the most likely cell types based on the presence of these markers. Alternatively, perhaps the cell in question is a cerebellar astrocyte (Bergmann glia) which might express some Purkinje cell markers? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the top three are Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, and then another type like microglia or oligodendrocytes. But Pla2g7 is more associated with macrophages/microglia. However, given that most markers are astrocyte-related, maybe astrocytes are first, Purkinje cells second, and the third could be a different type. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different neuronal type. 

Wait, another approach: look up each gene's known cell type markers. 

Atp1a2: Astrocytes. 

Aldoc: Purkinje cells (neurons). 

Gpr37l1: Astrocytes (Bergmann glia), maybe. 

Atp1b2: Astrocytes. 

Ntsr2: Astrocytes. 

Slc1a3 (GLAST): Astrocytes. 

Slc1a2 (GLT-1): Astrocytes. 

Sparcl1: Astrocytes. 

Ndrg2: Astrocytes. 

Pla2g7: Macrophages/microglia. 

So most markers are astrocyte-specific. Aldoc is Purkinje cell-specific. Pla2g7 might be microglia. So the top three would be Astrocytes (highest), Purkinje cells (second), and Microglia (third). Alternatively, maybe Bergmann glia are a subtype of astrocytes, but Aldoc is Purkinje neuron. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is a mixture, but according to the markers, the cell has both astrocyte and Purkinje markers. But cells usually don't co-express both. So perhaps the sample contains a mixture of cells. But the problem is asking for the top 3 cell types using these markers. Since most markers are astrocyte, the first is Astrocyte. Then, since Aldoc is specific to Purkinje cells, that's second. Then Pla2g7 suggests microglia. So the top three would be Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, Microglia. 

Alternatively, maybe Oligodendrocytes? Let me check: Ndrg2 is linked to astrocytes, not oligodendrocytes. Gpr37l1 is in astrocytes. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is endothelial cells, but I don't see markers for that. 

Another possibility: Some of these markers might be in ependymal cells, but not sure. 

Given that, the top three cell types would be Astrocytes (most markers), Purkinje cells (Aldoc), and Microglia (Pla2g7). So the answer would be Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, Microglia. But wait, let me check Pla2g7 again. PLA2G7 is also known as PAF-AH, and in the brain, it's expressed in some neurons and microglia. So if Pla2g7 is present, that could indicate microglia. 

Alternatively, if the cell has both Aldoc and astrocyte markers, maybe it's a Bergmann glia, which are astrocytes in the cerebellum, but they might not express Aldoc. Aldoc is specific to Purkinje cells. So if the markers are from a single cell, it's conflicting. But the problem may have markers from a dataset with multiple cells. So the presence of Aldoc suggests Purkinje cells, and the rest suggest astrocytes. So the top cell types would be Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, and Microglia. 

But wait, another angle: In some cases, certain markers might be co-expressed. For example, some studies show that Ntsr2 is expressed in a subset of astrocytes. Slc1a3 and Slc1a2 are typical astrocyte markers. Atp1a2 and Atp1b2 are also astrocyte markers. So majority point to astrocytes. Aldoc is a strong Purkinje cell marker. So that's two cell types. The third could be Microglia due to Pla2g7. But maybe another cell type? Let me check Gpr37l1: Some sources say it's expressed in astrocytes, specifically in the cerebellum (Bergmann glia), but also in other astrocytes. 

Sparcl1 is expressed in astrocytes and some neurons. Ndrg2 is astrocyte-enriched. 

So, considering all, the top three would be:

1. Astrocytes (most markers)
2. Purkinje cells (due to Aldoc)
3. Microglia (due to Pla2g7)

Alternatively, maybe Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) if some markers are present, but I don't see markers like Pdgfra. 

Alternatively, if Pla2g7 is not strong for microglia, then maybe the third is another type of neuron. But the other markers (Ntsr2, Gpr37l1) are astrocyte. 

So I think the answer is Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, Microglia.

Astrocytes, Purkinje cells, Microglia
