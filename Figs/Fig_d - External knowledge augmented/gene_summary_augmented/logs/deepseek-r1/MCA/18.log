Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Dlk1: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats that functions as a regulator of cell growth. The encoded protein is involved in the differentiation of several cell types including adipocytes. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 14 frequently showing unparental disomy, and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. A single nucleotide variant in this gene is associated with child and adolescent obesity and shows polar overdominance, where heterozygotes carrying an active paternal allele express the phenotype, while mutant homozygotes are normal. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- H19: This gene is located in an imprinted region of chromosome 11 near the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. This gene is only expressed from the maternally-inherited chromosome, whereas IGF2 is only expressed from the paternally-inherited chromosome. The product of this gene is a long non-coding RNA which functions as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and Wilms tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015]
- Postn: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
- Col1a2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea, dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome. Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity. Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals, have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]
- Itm2a: This gene encodes a type II membrane protein that belongs to the ITM2 family. Studies in mouse suggest that it may be involved in osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2010]
- Aspn: This gene encodes a cartilage extracellular protein that is member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family. The encoded protein may regulate chondrogenesis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta 1-induced gene expression in cartilage. This protein also binds collagen and calcium and may induce collagen mineralization. Polymorphisms in the aspartic acid repeat region of this gene are associated with a susceptibility to osteoarthritis, and also with intervertebral disc disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]
- Fstl1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing 10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Mfap5: This gene encodes a 25-kD microfibril-associated glycoprotein which is a component of microfibrils of the extracellular matrix. The encoded protein promotes attachment of cells to microfibrils via alpha-V-beta-3 integrin. Deficiency of this gene in mice results in neutropenia. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]
- Col3a1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]
- Igf2: This gene encodes a member of the insulin family of polypeptide growth factors, which are involved in development and growth. It is an imprinted gene, expressed only from the paternal allele, and epigenetic changes at this locus are associated with Wilms tumour, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Silver-Russell syndrome. A read-through INS-IGF2 gene exists, whose 5' region overlaps the INS gene and the 3' region overlaps this gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2010]

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers. The markers provided are Dlk1, H19, Postn, Col1a2, Itm2a, Aspn, Fstl1, Mfap5, Col3a1, and Igf2.

First, I need to recall what each of these genes are associated with. Let me go through each gene's summary again to get a sense of their functions and which cell types they might be markers for.

Starting with Dlk1: It's involved in adipocyte differentiation and is imprinted, expressed from the paternal allele. Adipocytes are fat cells, but Dlk1 is also mentioned in cell growth regulation. Maybe it's a marker for preadipocytes or stem cells in adipose tissue.

H19: A maternally expressed imprinted gene near Igf2. It's a lncRNA acting as a tumor suppressor. H19 is often associated with placental and embryonic tissues, and since Igf2 is paternally expressed, both are involved in growth regulation. These imprinted genes might be markers for embryonic stem cells or placental cells.

Postn: Encodes an extracellular matrix protein involved in tissue development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Postn is known in fibroblasts, especially in contexts like heart remodeling (cardiac fibroblasts) or cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Col1a2 and Col3a1: Both are collagen genes. Col1a2 is part of type I collagen, abundant in bone, skin, tendon. Col3a1 is type III collagen, found in skin, lung, vascular system. These collagens are typical markers for fibroblasts, osteoblasts (bone cells), or other connective tissue cells.

Itm2a: Involved in osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation. So this might be a marker for osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) or chondrocytes (cartilage cells).

Aspn: Encodes a cartilage extracellular protein, part of the proteoglycan family. Associated with osteoarthritis susceptibility. This points towards chondrocytes.

Fstl1: Similar to follistatin, which binds activin. It's an autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis. Follistatin-related proteins can be involved in muscle development or inflammation. Maybe in mesenchymal stem cells or muscle cells?

Mfap5: Microfibril-associated glycoprotein, part of extracellular microfibrils. Found in tissues with elastic fibers, like blood vessels, skin. Might be in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells.

Igf2: Insulin-like growth factor 2, involved in growth, imprinted (paternal). Expressed in various tissues, including liver, muscle, and during development. Could be in hepatocytes, muscle cells, or placental cells.

Now, grouping these markers. Collagens (Col1a2, Col3a1) and Postn, Mfap5, Aspn are all ECM-related. Fibroblasts are a major source of ECM proteins. Postn (periostin) is a known fibroblast marker, especially in activated states. Col1a2 and Col3a1 are classic fibroblast markers. Aspn is cartilage-related, but if other markers are more fibroblastic, maybe it's part of a connective tissue cell type.

Itm2a points towards osteoblasts or chondrocytes. However, if other markers are more dominant in fibroblasts, maybe Itm2a here is part of a fibroblast subset. Dlk1 and H19 are imprinted genes, which are often involved in stem cells or progenitor cells. Adipocyte differentiation (Dlk1) might suggest preadipocytes, but if other ECM markers are present, perhaps it's a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) that can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, etc.

H19 and Igf2 being imprinted and involved in growth might be in MSCs or progenitor cells. Fstl1 could be in MSCs as well, involved in differentiation.

So combining these, the most likely cell types would be:

1. Fibroblasts: Because of Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, which are all ECM components. Fibroblasts are the primary producers of these.

2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs): Dlk1, H19, Igf2, Itm2a, Aspn, Fstl1. MSCs can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes. The presence of differentiation markers and imprinted genes might indicate a progenitor cell type.

3. Chondrocytes: Aspn is specific to cartilage, Itm2a is involved in chondrogenic differentiation. However, if Col1a2 and Col3a1 are more dominant, maybe osteoblasts. But Col1a2 is more bone (type I collagen), while Col3a1 is in more flexible tissues. Alternatively, considering Aspn and Itm2a, maybe chondrocytes. However, if other markers are more prevalent, perhaps osteoblasts.

Wait, but Col1a2 is a major component of bone. Itm2a is involved in osteogenic differentiation. So maybe osteoblasts. However, Postn is more associated with fibroblasts and cardiac valves. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering that fibroblasts are the top, then MSCs, and then either osteoblasts or chondrocytes. But which markers are more specific? Aspn is cartilage-specific, so perhaps chondrocytes. However, some of these genes might be co-expressed in certain contexts.

Alternatively, maybe the third is myofibroblasts, which are activated fibroblasts expressing Postn. But given the other markers like Itm2a and Aspn, maybe the third is osteoblasts.

But I need to prioritize based on the combination. Another angle: look for cell types known to express multiple of these markers.

Fibroblasts: Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, Fstl1. Yes, these are all found in fibroblasts.

Mesenchymal stem cells: Dlk1, H19, Igf2, Itm2a (since they can differentiate into osteo/chondro). MSCs also produce some ECM, but maybe lower levels compared to fibroblasts.

Chondrocytes: Aspn, Col2a1 is more specific, but here we have Col1a2 and Col3a1. However, Aspn is a strong indicator. Maybe Itm2a and Aspn together point to chondrocytes.

Alternatively, considering H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and involved in growth, perhaps they are in placental cells or some progenitor cells. But the other markers are more ECM-related.

Another approach: check each gene's typical cell types.

Dlk1: Adipocyte precursors, hepatoblasts, some stem cells.

H19: Embryonic tissues, placenta, some cancers.

Postn: Fibroblasts, osteoblasts, cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Col1a2: Fibroblasts, osteoblasts.

Itm2a: Osteoblasts, chondrocytes.

Aspn: Chondrocytes.

Fstl1: Various, including heart, lung, and involved in inflammation.

Mfap5: Fibroblasts, associated with microfibrils.

Col3a1: Fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells.

Igf2: Liver, muscle, placenta, fetal tissues.

Putting this together, the markers are a mix of fibroblast, osteoblast, chondrocyte, and some stem/progenitor markers. However, the strongest presence is in fibroblasts due to multiple collagen genes and Postn. Then, perhaps osteoblasts (Col1a2, Itm2a) or MSCs (Dlk1, H19, Igf2). Aspn points to chondrocytes.

But which is more probable? If the majority are fibroblast markers, then fibroblasts first. Then, considering Itm2a and Col1a2, osteoblasts would be next. Alternatively, MSCs might express Dlk1, H19, Igf2 along with some collagen.

Alternatively, maybe the second is myofibroblasts (activated fibroblasts with Postn), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the top three as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. Let me check the markers again:

Fibroblasts: Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, Fstl1 (maybe)

Osteoblasts: Col1a2, Itm2a, Postn (sometimes), Dlk1 (if in progenitors)

Chondrocytes: Aspn, Col2a1 (not listed here), but Aspn is present. Itm2a is also involved in chondrogenic differentiation.

But since Col2a1 isn't in the markers, maybe chondrocytes are less likely. Alternatively, maybe Itm2a and Aspn are enough.

Alternatively, considering Dlk1 and H19, which are imprinted and involved in growth, perhaps they are in hepatic cells? But Igf2 is also in liver, but other markers don't support that.

Alternatively, considering that H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and often co-expressed in placental or embryonic tissues. But again, other markers are ECM-related.

Alternatively, maybe the cell types are:

1. Fibroblasts

2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells

3. Osteoblasts

But need to confirm. Another thought: periosteal cells (which are a type of progenitor cell for bone) might express Postn, Col1a2, Itm2a, etc.

Alternatively, cardiac fibroblasts express Postn, especially in heart remodeling.

But given that the question is about mouse cells in general, not specific tissues, the most common cell types would be fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes.

So ranking them based on the number of markers:

Fibroblasts: Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, Fstl1 (maybe). That's five markers.

Osteoblasts: Col1a2, Itm2a, Dlk1 (if involved in differentiation). Maybe three markers.

Chondrocytes: Aspn, Itm2a. Two markers.

But Fstl1 is also found in fibroblasts. So fibroblasts are top.

Then, osteoblasts (Col1a2, Itm2a, maybe Postn). But Postn is more fibroblast-related. So maybe osteoblasts second.

Third could be chondrocytes (Aspn, Itm2a). But perhaps MSCs with Dlk1, H19, Igf2. MSCs would have markers of multiple lineages. H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and involved in growth, which are typical in stem cells.

So maybe the top three:

1. Fibroblasts

2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells

3. Osteoblasts

Alternatively, if MSCs are considered a broader category and the markers include both MSC and differentiated cells, but the presence of Dlk1 (adipogenic), Itm2a (osteo/chondro), and others might suggest MSCs.

Alternatively, the third could be chondrocytes, but with fewer markers.

Alternatively, maybe the third is myofibroblasts, but that's a subset of fibroblasts.

Alternatively, considering H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and often co-expressed in certain tissues, but without more specific markers, it's hard.

Alternatively, looking up marker combinations:

- Fibroblasts: Col1a1/Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5.

- Osteoblasts: Col1a2, Itm2a, Postn (in some contexts), Aspn (maybe not).

Wait, Aspn is more chondrocyte. So maybe:

1. Fibroblasts

2. Osteoblasts

3. Chondrocytes

But the presence of H19 and Igf2, which are imprinted and involved in growth, might suggest a progenitor cell type. However, if the majority of markers are ECM-related, perhaps the top three are fibroblasts, then osteoblasts, then chondrocytes.

Alternatively, since Dlk1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation, but there's no other adipocyte markers like Fabp4, maybe adipocyte progenitors are not the main here.

Alternatively, considering that Itm2a is involved in both osteo and chondrogenic, and Aspn is chondrogenic, the third could be chondrocytes.

So, compiling:

Top 3:

1. Fibroblasts (Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, Fstl1)

2. Osteoblasts (Col1a2, Itm2a, Dlk1?)

3. Chondrocytes (Aspn, Itm2a)

Alternatively, if Dlk1 is more MSC or preadipocyte, maybe MSCs come second.

But given the markers, I think the most supported are fibroblasts as top, then osteoblasts, then chondrocytes. But I need to verify.

Wait, another angle: look up standard markers for cell types.

Fibroblasts: Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, etc. Yes.

Osteoblasts: Col1a2, Runx2, Osteocalcin (Bglap), Itm2a is mentioned in osteogenic differentiation.

Chondrocytes: Col2a1, Aggrecan (Acan), Sox9, Aspn.

But in the given markers, Col2a1 is not present, but Aspn is. So maybe chondrocytes are possible.

MSCs: Markers like Cd44, Cd73, Cd90, but these are surface markers not listed here. However, MSCs can express ECM genes during differentiation.

Given the provided markers, the strongest case is fibroblasts first, then osteoblasts (Col1a2, Itm2a), then chondrocytes (Aspn, Itm2a). However, Itm2a is present in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes.

Alternatively, maybe the second is MSCs (Dlk1, H19, Igf2, Itm2a, Fstl1), which can differentiate into multiple lineages. Then third could be osteoblasts.

But this requires knowing which markers are more specific. H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and often in stem/progenitor cells.

So perhaps:

1. Fibroblasts

2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells

3. Osteoblasts

But I'm a bit torn. Another way: check if any of these genes are definitive for a cell type.

For example, Aspn is pretty specific to chondrocytes. Itm2a is involved in osteo and chondro. Col1a2 is more osteoblast and fibroblast.

Postn is fibroblast and some osteoblast contexts.

Dlk1 is adipocyte progenitors but also other stem cells.

H19 and Igf2 are imprinted and in stem cells.

So perhaps the combination suggests:

1. Fibroblasts (Col1a2, Col3a1, Postn, Mfap5, Fstl1)

2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (Dlk1, H19, Igf2, Itm2a)

3. Osteoblasts (Col1a2, Itm2a, Postn)

Alternatively, if MSCs are considered a broader category that includes progenitors for osteoblasts and fibroblasts, they might be second.

But given the task is to list the top 3 cell types, I think the answer is:

Fibroblasts, Osteoblasts, Chondrocytes.

Alternatively, if MSCs are higher because of the imprinted genes, but MSCs are a bit more of a progenitor type, while the collagens are more differentiated.

Given that, the final answer is likely Fibroblasts, Osteoblasts, Chondrocytes, ranked by the number of markers and specificity.
