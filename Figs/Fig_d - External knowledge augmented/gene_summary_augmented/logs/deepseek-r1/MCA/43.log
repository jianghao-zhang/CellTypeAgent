Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Kctd14: Predicted to be involved in protein homooligomerization. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Lgals7: The galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Differential and in situ hybridization studies indicate that this lectin is specifically expressed in keratinocytes and found mainly in stratified squamous epithelium. A duplicate copy of this gene (GeneID:653499) is found adjacent to, but on the opposite strand on chromosome 19. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Gng13: Heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of alpha (see MIM 139320), beta (see MIM 139380), and gamma subunits, function as signal transducers for the 7-transmembrane-helix G protein-coupled receptors. GNG13 is a gamma subunit that is expressed in taste, retinal, and neuronal tissues and plays a key role in taste transduction (Li et al., 2006 [PubMed 16473877]).[supplied by OMIM, Oct 2009]
- Bmyc: Gene ID not found
- Ifitm1: Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of interferon induced antiviral proteins. The family contains five members, including IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 that belong to the CD225 superfamily. The protein encoded by this gene restricts cellular entry by diverse viral pathogens, such as influenza A virus, Ebola virus and Sars-CoV-2. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2021]
- Gstm2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual's susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and efficacy of certain drugs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Laptm4b: Enables ceramide binding activity; enzyme binding activity; and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate binding activity. Involved in several processes, including negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of lysosomal membrane permeability; and regulation of lysosome organization. Located in several cellular components, including endosome; lysosomal membrane; and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Amhr2: This gene encodes the receptor for the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) which, in addition to testosterone, results in male sex differentiation. AMH and testosterone are produced in the testes by different cells and have different effects. Testosterone promotes the development of male genitalia while the binding of AMH to the encoded receptor prevents the development of the mullerian ducts into uterus and Fallopian tubes. Mutations in this gene are associated with persistent Mullerian duct syndrome type II. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]
- Wnt6: The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It is overexpressed in cervical cancer cell line and strongly coexpressed with another family member, WNT10A, in colorectal cancer cell line. The gene overexpression may play key roles in carcinogenesis. This gene and the WNT10A gene are clustered in the chromosome 2q35 region. The protein encoded by this gene is 97% identical to the mouse Wnt6 protein at the amino acid level. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ldhb: This gene encodes the B subunit of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+ in a post-glycolysis process. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Recent studies have shown that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Mutations in this gene are associated with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X, 5 and 13. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]

Okay, so I need to figure out the top 3 cell types in mouse based on the given markers. Let's start by going through each gene and see what cell types they are associated with.

First, Lgals7. The description says it's specifically expressed in keratinocytes and found in stratified squamous epithelium. That's a strong indicator for keratinocytes. So maybe the first cell type is keratinocytes.

Next, Amhr2. This gene encodes the receptor for anti-Mullerian hormone, which is involved in male sex differentiation. AMH is produced in the testes, so this might be related to Sertoli cells or other testicular cells. But Amhr2 is the receptor, so cells that respond to AMH, like Mullerian duct cells, but in males, AMH causes regression of Mullerian ducts. So perhaps cells in the testes, like Sertoli cells, which produce AMH. So maybe Sertoli cells are a candidate.

Gng13 is part of the G protein-coupled receptors in taste transduction. The description mentions it's expressed in taste, retinal, and neuronal tissues. So taste receptor cells might be another cell type. Taste bud cells or gustatory cells could be here.

Ifitm1 is involved in antiviral response, part of interferon-induced proteins. These are often found in immune cells. Maybe T cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells. But Ifitm1 is more general in antiviral activity, so maybe immune cells in general, but not sure which specific type yet.

Gstm2 is a glutathione S-transferase involved in detoxification. These enzymes are found in liver cells (hepatocytes) for detox processes. So hepatocytes might be another possibility.

Ldhb is the B subunit of lactate dehydrogenase, involved in converting pyruvate to lactate. This is important in cells with high glycolytic activity, like muscle cells (especially fast-twitch muscle fibers) or possibly certain cancer cells. But in normal physiology, muscle cells use LDH isoforms. Ldhb is part of the LDH enzyme family, so maybe muscle cells or cells with high energy demands.

Wnt6 is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, involved in development and carcinogenesis. Wnt genes are important in stem cells, embryonic development, and certain epithelial cells. Maybe some epithelial stem cells or cells in the digestive tract?

Kctd14 is involved in protein homooligomerization. Not much specific info here, so maybe not a strong marker for a specific cell type.

Bmyc: Gene ID not found, so probably a typo or outdated symbol. Maybe they meant Myc, but unsure. So I can ignore this one.

Laptm4b is involved in lysosomal processes and membrane permeability. Found in endosomes and lysosomes. This might be present in cells with active lysosomal activity, like macrophages or other phagocytic cells.

Putting this all together:

1. Lgals7 points to keratinocytes.
2. Amhr2 suggests Sertoli cells or other testicular cells.
3. Gng13 indicates taste receptor cells.

But need to check if other markers support these. Ifitm1 might be present in immune cells, but if the other markers don't align, maybe not in top 3. Gstm2 in hepatocytes, but unless other markers like Ldhb (liver also has LDH, but not sure). Ldhb in muscle? Let me cross-check.

Alternatively, some cell types might have multiple markers. For example, if a cell type has both Lgals7 and another marker, but I don't see overlapping markers here. Let me think again.

Keratinocytes are a strong first due to Lgals7. Then, Amhr2 is specific for cells involved in male reproductive system, like Sertoli cells. Gng13 for taste cells. Those are three distinct cell types. Alternatively, maybe some epithelial cells, but Lgals7 is more specific for stratified squamous epithelium like skin.

So the top 3 would be Keratinocytes, Sertoli cells, and Taste receptor cells. But maybe there's another combination. Let me check other markers again.

Ifitm1: immune cells. Maybe if there are other immune markers, but the others don't seem to align. Gstm2 could be liver, but no other liver markers. Laptm4b in lysosomal cells, maybe macrophages. But if only the top three, based on the strongest markers (Lgals7, Amhr2, Gng13), then the answer would be the three cell types associated with those.
