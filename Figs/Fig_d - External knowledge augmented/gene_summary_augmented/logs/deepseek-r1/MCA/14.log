Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Fabp4: FABP4 encodes the fatty acid binding protein found in adipocytes.  Fatty acid binding proteins are a family of small, highly conserved, cytoplasmic proteins that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. It is thought that FABPs roles include fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Cldn5: This gene encodes a member of the claudin family. Claudins are integral membrane proteins and components of tight junction strands. Tight junction strands serve as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space between epithelial or endothelial cell sheets. Mutations in this gene have been found in patients with velocardiofacial syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]
- Ramp2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAMP family of single-transmembrane-domain proteins, called receptor (calcitonin) activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). RAMPs are type I transmembrane proteins with an extracellular N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus. RAMPs are required to transport calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CRLR) to the plasma membrane. CRLR, a receptor with seven transmembrane domains, can function as either a calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor or an adrenomedullin receptor, depending on which members of the RAMP family are expressed. In the presence of this (RAMP2) protein, CRLR functions as an adrenomedullin receptor. The RAMP2 protein is involved in core glycosylation and transportation of adrenomedullin receptor to the cell surface. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Egfl7: This gene encodes a secreted endothelial cell protein that contains two epidermal growth factor-like domains. The encoded protein may play a role in regulating vasculogenesis. This protein may be involved in the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]
- Cav1: The scaffolding protein encoded by this gene is the main component of the caveolae plasma membranes found in most cell types. The protein links integrin subunits to the tyrosine kinase FYN, an initiating step in coupling integrins to the Ras-ERK pathway and promoting cell cycle progression. The gene is a tumor suppressor gene candidate and a negative regulator of the Ras-p42/44 mitogen-activated kinase cascade. Caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 are located next to each other on chromosome 7 and express colocalizing proteins that form a stable hetero-oligomeric complex. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy. Alternatively spliced transcripts encode alpha and beta isoforms of caveolin 1.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]
- Cd36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin, anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]
- Esam: Enables cell-cell adhesion mediator activity. Involved in several processes, including bicellular tight junction assembly; cell-cell adhesion; and regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. Located in cell-cell junction and plasma membrane. Part of protein-containing complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Gpihbp1: This gene encodes a capillary endothelial cell protein that facilitates the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The encoded protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a member of the lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly6) family. This protein plays a major role in transporting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the subendothelial spaces to the capillary lumen. Mutations in this gene are the cause of hyperlipoproteinemia, type 1D. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]
- Ly6c1: Gene ID not found
- Tm4sf1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is a cell surface antigen and is highly expressed in different carcinomas. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 cell types for mouse cells based on these markers. The markers listed are Fabp4, Cldn5, Ramp2, Egfl7, Cav1, Cd36, Esam, Gpihbp1, Ly6c1, Tm4sf1. Hmm. 

First, I should go through each gene and recall which cell types they are associated with. Let me start with Fabp4. From the description, Fabp4 is found in adipocytes. So that's a strong indicator of adipocytes or fat cells. Adipocytes are definitely a candidate.

Next, Cldn5. The gene encodes a claudin family member, which are part of tight junctions. Claudins are typically found in endothelial cells, especially in the blood-brain barrier. So Cldn5 is a marker for endothelial cells. That's another cell type.

Ramp2. The description says it's involved with adrenomedullin receptors and CRLR. RAMP2 is associated with endothelial cells as well, particularly in vascular development. So another point for endothelial cells.

Egfl7. This is a secreted endothelial cell protein involved in vasculogenesis. So again, endothelial cells. That's three markers pointing towards endothelial.

Cav1 encodes caveolin 1, which is a major component of caveolae. Caveolae are found in many cell types but notably in endothelial cells and adipocytes. So both of those cell types might be relevant here.

Cd36 is a receptor involved in fatty acid transport and platelet aggregation. It's found in adipocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Hmm. So Cd36 could be in adipocytes or endothelial cells.

Esam is involved in cell-cell adhesion and tight junctions. Endothelial cells again, perhaps. Esam is known to be endothelial-specific in some contexts.

Gpihbp1 is a capillary endothelial cell protein that helps with lipoprotein lipase. So definitely endothelial, maybe specific to capillary endothelial cells.

Ly6c1 wasn't found in the database, but Ly6c is a marker often associated with monocytes and subsets of lymphocytes, like Ly6C+ monocytes. But since the gene ID wasn't found, maybe it's not as reliable here. Alternatively, Ly6c1 might be a marker for certain immune cells, but I'm not sure.

Tm4sf1 is a tetraspanin family member, expressed in carcinomas, but also found in endothelial cells. It's involved in cell motility and might be present in endothelial or cancer cells. But since we're talking normal mouse cells, maybe endothelial.

Putting this all together: Fabp4 strongly suggests adipocytes. Then, Cldn5, Ramp2, Egfl7, Cav1, Esam, Gpihbp1, Tm4sf1 all point to endothelial cells. Cd36 could be adipocytes or endothelial. Ly6c1 is uncertain but maybe immune cells. But given the majority of markers here are endothelial, the top cell type is likely endothelial cells. Adipocytes would be second because of Fabp4 and Cd36. Then maybe macrophages or monocytes for Cd36 and Ly6c1, but since Ly6c1 wasn't found, maybe other cell types. Alternatively, maybe smooth muscle cells? Wait, but Cav1 is also in adipocytes and endothelial. Let's check again.

Wait, endothelial cells have Cldn5 (tight junctions), Ramp2 (vascular), Egfl7 (vasculogenesis), Cav1 (caveolae in endothelial), Esam (endothelial cell adhesion), Gpihbp1 (capillary endothelial), Tm4sf1 (endothelial). That's a lot of markers. Adipocytes have Fabp4, Cd36 (maybe), and Cav1. So adipocytes are a strong second. Then Cd36 is also found in macrophages, but with other markers not pointing to immune cells. Alternatively, Cd36 is in endothelial and adipocytes. Maybe the third cell type could be macrophages, but without more markers like CD11b or F4/80, maybe not. Alternatively, smooth muscle cells? But I don't see markers like Acta2 or Myh11. Alternatively, maybe platelets, since Cd36 is on platelets, but other markers don't support that. Alternatively, maybe another type of endothelial cell subtype? Maybe lymphatic endothelial? But not sure. Alternatively, maybe fibroblasts. But I don't see typical fibroblast markers like Col1a1.

Alternatively, Cd36 is also in adipocytes, so maybe the third cell type is something else. Wait, Tm4sf1 is in endothelial and maybe some epithelial cells. But Cldn5 is endothelial or epithelial tight junctions. However, Cldn5 is specifically endothelial in many contexts. So perhaps the top three are endothelial cells, adipocytes, and maybe macrophages. But with the given markers, maybe endothelial cells (most markers), adipocytes (Fabp4, Cd36, Cav1), and then maybe a subtype of endothelial cells? Or perhaps smooth muscle? But again, not sure. Alternatively, considering that Gpihbp1 is specific for capillary endothelial cells, maybe the third is a specific type of endothelial, but the question just asks for cell types, not subtypes. Alternatively, maybe pericytes, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different type, but without more markers. Alternatively, considering that Cd36 and Fabp4 are in adipocytes, and the other markers are mostly endothelial, maybe macrophages as third. But without more immune markers, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of epithelial cell, but Cldn5 is in endothelial tight junctions. Hmm.

Alternatively, the third could be a different cell type. Let's see. Ly6c1 is not found, so maybe that's not helpful. Tm4sf1 is in endothelial and some cancer cells, but maybe also in other cells. Maybe the third is a stem cell type? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of endothelial cell. But probably, the top three would be:

1. Endothelial cells (Cldn5, Ramp2, Egfl7, Cav1, Esam, Gpihbp1, Tm4sf1)
2. Adipocytes (Fabp4, Cd36, Cav1)
3. Macrophages (Cd36), but maybe not enough markers. Alternatively, smooth muscle cells? But no markers like Acta2. Alternatively, another possibility: CD36 is also expressed in some endothelial cells, so maybe the third cell type is something else. Alternatively, maybe pericytes, but without markers like Pdgfrb. Hmm. Maybe the third is not strong, but given the markers, the top two are clear. The third might be harder. Alternatively, considering that Cd36 is also in macrophages, but if Ly6c1 is a marker for Ly6C+ monocytes/macrophages, even though the gene ID wasn't found, maybe Ly6c1 is a typo or alias. Assuming Ly6c1 is a monocyte marker, then maybe macrophages. So top three could be Endothelial cells, Adipocytes, Macrophages. Alternatively, if Ly6c1 is not considered, maybe the third is another cell type like epithelial, but not enough markers. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different type of fat cell or something else. But I think the most logical top three are:

Endothelial cells, Adipocytes, and Macrophages. But I need to confirm based on the markers. Let's list the markers again:

Endothelial: Cldn5, Ramp2, Egfl7, Cav1, Esam, Gpihbp1, Tm4sf1
Adipocytes: Fabp4, Cd36, Cav1
Macrophages: Cd36, maybe Ly6c1 (if it's Ly6C)

But since Ly6c1 gene ID wasn't found, maybe that's not reliable. So perhaps the third is another cell type. Alternatively, maybe smooth muscle cells if Cd36 is present. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is pericytes. Alternatively, maybe platelets, but Cd36 is there, but other markers don't support. Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of epithelial cell, but Cldn5 is in endothelial. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering Tm4sf1 is also in some stem cells or cancer cells, but in normal cells, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe fibroblasts. But I don't see fibroblast markers. Maybe the third is not strong. But the user wants top 3, so I have to pick. Given that, the third might be macrophages, but with only Cd36 and maybe Ly6c1 (if that's a valid marker). Alternatively, maybe not. Maybe the third is another type of endothelial cell, but the question probably wants distinct cell types. So perhaps the top three are:

1. Endothelial cells
2. Adipocytes
3. Macrophages

But I need to check if Cd36 is more specific. Cd36 is in adipocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. So if the markers include Cd36 and Fabp4, then adipocytes are a strong second. For third, maybe macrophages. Alternatively, if there's another marker pointing to another cell type. Let me check again the list:

The markers provided are: Fabp4 (adipocyte), Cldn5 (endothelial), Ramp2 (endothelial), Egfl7 (endothelial), Cav1 (endothelial, adipocyte), Cd36 (adipocyte, macrophage, endothelial), Esam (endothelial), Gpihbp1 (endothelial), Ly6c1 (unknown, maybe immune), Tm4sf1 (endothelial). 

So most markers point to endothelial. Fabp4 is specific to adipocytes. Cd36 is in adipocytes and others. So the top two are clear. The third is tricky. Since Ly6c1 is not found, maybe the next one is macrophages, but only Cd36 and possibly Ly6c1 (if it's a monocyte marker). Alternatively, maybe smooth muscle cells, but no markers. Alternatively, maybe pericytes. Alternatively, maybe the third is not present and the answer is just two cell types, but the user wants three. Maybe the third is a type of endothelial cell, but that's not different. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different cell type, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe platelets, but Cd36 is there. Alternatively, maybe the third is a type of epithelial cell. But Cldn5 is in endothelial. Alternatively, maybe the third is a different type of fat cell, but not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a different cell type that expresses Cd36 and Cav1. For example, macrophages (Cd36), but also Cav1 can be expressed in macrophages. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe smooth muscle cells express Cav1 and Cd36? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is a hepatocyte, but no markers for that. 

Given the uncertainty, but the need to provide three, I think the third would be macrophages. So the top three would be:

Endothelial cells, Adipocytes, Macrophages.

But I should check if any other markers support other cell types. For example, Tm4sf1 is also in some cancer cells, but in normal cells, maybe endothelial. So sticking with the initial analysis.
