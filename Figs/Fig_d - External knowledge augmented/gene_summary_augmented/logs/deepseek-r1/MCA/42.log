Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Gzma: Cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells share the remarkable ability to recognize, bind, and lyse specific target cells. They are thought to protect their host by lysing cells bearing on their surface 'nonself' antigens, usually peptides or proteins resulting from infection by intracellular pathogens. The protein described here is a T cell- and natural killer cell-specific serine protease that may function as a common component necessary for lysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Ccl5: This gene is one of several chemokine genes clustered on the q-arm of chromosome 17. Chemokines form a superfamily of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The superfamily is divided into four subfamilies based on the arrangement of the N-terminal cysteine residues of the mature peptide. This chemokine, a member of the CC subfamily, functions as a chemoattractant for blood monocytes, memory T helper cells and eosinophils. It causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. This cytokine is one of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ cells. It functions as one of the natural ligands for the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), and it suppresses in vitro replication of the R5 strains of HIV-1, which use CCR5 as a coreceptor. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
- Gzmb: This gene encodes a member of the granzyme subfamily of proteins, part of the peptidase S1 family of serine proteases. The encoded preproprotein is secreted by natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and proteolytically processed to generate the active protease, which induces target cell apoptosis. This protein also processes cytokines and degrades extracellular matrix proteins, and these roles are implicated in chronic inflammation and wound healing. Expression of this gene may be elevated in human patients with cardiac fibrosis. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]
- Cd7: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is found on thymocytes and mature T cells. It plays an essential role in T-cell interactions and also in T-cell/B-cell interaction during early lymphoid development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Rgs1: This gene encodes a member of the regulator of G-protein signalling family. This protein is located on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and contains a conserved, 120 amino acid motif called the RGS domain. The protein attenuates the signalling activity of G-proteins by binding to activated, GTP-bound G alpha subunits and acting as a GTPase activating protein (GAP), increasing the rate of conversion of the GTP to GDP. This hydrolysis allows the G alpha subunits to bind G beta/gamma subunit heterodimers, forming inactive G-protein heterotrimers, thereby terminating the signal. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- AW112010: Gene ID not found
- Cd3g: The protein encoded by this gene is the CD3-gamma polypeptide, which together with CD3-epsilon, -delta and -zeta, and the T-cell receptor alpha/beta and gamma/delta heterodimers, forms the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. This complex plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signal-transduction pathways. The genes encoding the epsilon, gamma and delta polypeptides are located in the same cluster on chromosome 11. Defects in this gene are associated with T cell immunodeficiency. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Nkg7: Predicted to be integral component of plasma membrane. Predicted to be active in plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Cd8a: The CD8 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on most cytotoxic T lymphocytes that mediates efficient cell-cell interactions within the immune system. The CD8 antigen acts as a coreceptor with the T-cell receptor on the T lymphocyte to recognize antigens displayed by an antigen presenting cell in the context of class I MHC molecules. The coreceptor functions as either a homodimer composed of two alpha chains or as a heterodimer composed of one alpha and one beta chain. Both alpha and beta chains share significant homology to immunoglobulin variable light chains. This gene encodes the CD8 alpha chain. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The major protein isoforms of this gene differ by the presence or absence of a transmembrane domain and thus differ in being a membrane-anchored or secreted protein. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]
- Tcrg-C2: Gene ID not found


Here are the marker genes, please finish the task: Gzma, Ccl5, Gzmb, Cd7, Rgs1, AW112010, Cd3g, Nkg7, Cd8a, Tcrg-C2

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. Let me go through each marker one by one and see which cell types they correspond to.

First, Gzma (Granzyme A) is mentioned as being specific to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. So that points towards T cells and NK cells. Then, Ccl5 is a chemokine involved in attracting monocytes, memory T helper cells, and eosinophils. It's also linked to CD8+ T cells because it's a major HIV-suppressive factor produced by them. Gzmb (Granzyme B) is similar to Gzma, found in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, involved in apoptosis. 

Cd7 is a transmembrane protein on thymocytes and mature T cells, important in T-cell interactions. Rgs1 is part of the regulator of G-protein signaling, which I recall is involved in lymphocyte activation and migration. AW112010 isn't found, so maybe I can ignore that. Cd3g is part of the CD3 complex, essential for T-cell receptor signaling. Nkg7 is associated with NK cells and cytotoxic T cells. Cd8a is a coreceptor on cytotoxic T cells. Tcrg-C2 isn't found, but TCR gamma chain is part of gamma-delta T cells, maybe.

Putting this together: Cd3g and Cd8a are strong T cell markers, specifically CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Gzma, Gzmb, and Nkg7 are all found in cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Ccl5 is also linked to CD8+ T cells. Cd7 is on T cells. Rgs1 might be in activated T cells. 

NK cells also express Gzma, Gzmb, and Nkg7. However, NK cells typically don't express CD3 or CD8a. So Cd3g and Cd8a would point more towards T cells. But since some markers overlap, the top cell type is likely CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Next, NK cells might be second. Then, maybe gamma-delta T cells because of Tcrg, but since that gene ID wasn't found, maybe another T cell subtype. Alternatively, memory T cells because of Ccl5. But Cd8a is specific for cytotoxic T cells. 

Wait, Cd8a is specific for CD8+ T cells, so that's the first. NK cells come next because Gzma, Gzmb, Nkg7 are present but without CD3 and CD8. Then, maybe another T cell subset like gamma-delta T cells if Tcrg-C2 is part of their receptor, but since that gene isn't found, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, activated T cells or memory T cells. But Rgs1 is involved in lymphocyte migration, maybe in activated T cells. 

Alternatively, considering Cd7 is on T cells, but also involved in early lymphoid development. So the markers are pointing towards cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), NK cells, and maybe another T cell type. But the strongest markers are CD8+ T cells first, NK cells second. Third could be gamma-delta T cells if TCRg is involved, but since that marker isn't found, maybe another type. Alternatively, maybe T helper cells? But Ccl5 is from CD8+ cells. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe memory T cells? Or maybe the third is a subset of T cells with activation markers. 

But based on the given markers, the most probable top three would be CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and maybe gamma-delta T cells. But I need to confirm if Cd3g is present in gamma-delta T cells. CD3 is part of the TCR complex, so gamma-delta T cells do have CD3. Cd8a is more for alpha-beta CD8+ T cells. Gamma-delta T cells usually don't express CD8. So maybe the third would be another T cell subset, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe activated T cells. But the strongest three based on the markers would be CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and possibly another T cell type. But considering Cd3g and Cd8a are specific for T cells, and the other markers overlap with NK cells, the top three are likely:

1. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells
2. Natural Killer (NK) cells
3. Gamma-delta T cells (if TCRg is considered, but since Tcrg-C2 wasn't found, maybe another T cell subset like memory T cells?)

Alternatively, maybe T helper cells? But Ccl5 is from CD8+ cells. Alternatively, maybe NKT cells (Natural Killer T cells), which share markers of both T cells and NK cells. Since they express CD3 (so Cd3g) and also some NK markers like Gzma and Gzmb. So possible third could be NKT cells. But that's a possibility. 

So, considering all markers, the most likely top three are:

1. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (due to Cd8a, Cd3g, Gzma, Gzmb, Ccl5)
2. NK cells (Gzma, Gzmb, Nkg7, but lacking T cell markers like Cd3 and Cd8)
3. NKT cells (if they express both T cell and NK markers) or Gamma-delta T cells

But the user probably expects standard cell types. Since the markers include Cd3g and Cd8a, which are T cell markers, and the other genes are present in both T and NK, but Cd8a is specific for CD8+ T cells. So the top three would be CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe gamma-delta T cells if TCRg is involved, but since that gene isn't found, perhaps another T cell type. Alternatively, memory CD8+ T cells. But I think the safest answer is:

Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), NK cells, and maybe Gamma-delta T cells. Alternatively, maybe the third is activated T cells. But given the markers, I'll go with the first two as clear, and the third as maybe Gamma-delta T cells or another T subset. Alternatively, maybe T helper cells are less likely. Alternatively, given Rgs1 is involved in lymphocyte migration, maybe activated T cells. But without more specific markers, it's hard. 

So, the answer is likely:

Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, Natural Killer cells, Gamma-delta T cells.

But let me check: Cd7 is also on T cells. Rgs1 is in activated lymphocytes. AW112010 is not found. So the third might be another T cell subset. Alternatively, given Cd7 is on thymocytes, maybe immature T cells, but that's less likely. Alternatively, memory T cells. But I think the third is Gamma-delta T cells, even if Tcrg-C2 isn't found. Alternatively, since Cd3g is part of the TCR complex, which is present in all T cells, including gamma-delta. So Gamma-delta T cells would have Cd3g but not Cd8a. So if a cell has Cd3g but not Cd8a, and maybe other markers, but in this case, Cd8a is present. So maybe Gamma-delta T cells are not the third. Alternatively, the user's markers include Cd8a, which is specific for CD8+ T cells, so Gamma-delta T cells usually don't express Cd8a. Therefore, the third cell type might be another CD8+ subset, but the top three would be CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe another T cell type like activated T cells. But since the user wants the most likely based on markers, I think CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe NKT cells (which express both T cell markers and NK markers). But NKT cells are a subset of T cells that express NK markers. They do have CD3 and TCR, so Cd3g would be present, and they might express some NK markers. So if the markers include both Cd3g and NK markers, NKT cells could be a possibility. But I'm not sure if NKT cells express Cd8a. Some NKT cells are CD8+, but many are CD4+ or double negative. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a memory CD8+ T cell. But the presence of Gzma and Gzmb suggests active cytotoxicity, so maybe effector CD8+ T cells. But the question is about cell types, not subsets. So the main types would be CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe Gamma-delta T cells. But since Gamma-delta T cells don't use Cd8a, unless they're a CD8+ subset. Hmm. Maybe the third is a T cell with activation markers. But given the markers, the safest top three are CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and Gamma-delta T cells. Alternatively, perhaps the third is a regulatory T cell, but that's not indicated here. 

Alternatively, given that Cd7 is also involved in early T cell development, maybe thymocytes? But the markers like Gzma and Gzmb are more in mature cytotoxic cells. So thymocytes are less likely. 

Given all this, the top three are most likely:

1. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells
2. Natural Killer (NK) cells
3. Gamma-delta T cells

But I need to check if Gamma-delta T cells express Cd3g, which they do, as all T cells have CD3. However, they don't express Cd8a typically. So if the markers include Cd8a, then Gamma-delta T cells are less likely. Therefore, the third might be another type. Wait, maybe the answer is just CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe CD4+ T cells? But Cd8a is specific for CD8+ T cells. Alternatively, maybe the third is a subset of CD8+ T cells, like effector or memory. But the question asks for cell types, not subsets. 

Alternatively, given that Cd3g is part of the T cell receptor complex, and Cd8a is CD8+ T cells, then the presence of both would strongly indicate CD8+ T cells. The presence of Gzma, Gzmb, and Nkg7 points towards cytotoxic activity, which aligns with CD8+ T cells and NK cells. So the top two are CD8+ T cells and NK cells. The third could be another cytotoxic cell type, but in mice, the major cytotoxic cells are CD8+ T and NK. The third might be NKT cells, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe activated T cells. But without more markers, it's hard. 

Alternatively, considering Ccl5 is produced by CD8+ T cells, which are already in the first position. So the third cell type might be a T helper cell, but there's no CD4 marker here. So maybe the answer is just CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and that's it. But the user wants top 3. Hmm. Maybe the third is gamma-delta T cells even if Cd8a is present. Alternatively, Cd8a is a heterodimer with Cd8b, but Cd8a can be expressed in some gamma-delta T cells. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe dendritic cells? But the markers don't support that. 

Wait, Cd7 is also on NK cells. Let me check: Cd7 is a marker for T cells and NK cells. If Cd7 is present, that could be both. So the markers Cd3g (T cell), Cd8a (CD8+ T), Gzma, Gzmb (both T and NK), Nkg7 (NK and T), Ccl5 (CD8+ T), Rgs1 (activated lymphocytes). So Cd3g and Cd8a are T cell specific, so the presence of those would indicate CD8+ T cells as the top. The other markers (Gzma, Gzmb, Nkg7, Ccl5) can be in both CD8+ T and NK cells. So the second is NK cells. Third, maybe a memory CD8+ T cell or activated CD8+ T cell, but those are subsets. Alternatively, maybe T cells with activation markers, but as a cell type, it's still T cells. 

Alternatively, since there's Cd3g and Cd8a, which are T cell markers, along with Gzmb and Gzma, which are cytotoxic, the first is CD8+ T. NK cells are second. Third could be Gamma-delta T cells, but without specific markers, maybe it's another T cell subset. But given that the user provided Tcrg-C2 (even though the Gene ID wasn't found), maybe that's a gamma chain of TCR, which is in gamma-delta T cells. So perhaps gamma-delta T cells are the third. Even though the Gene ID wasn't found, the name suggests TCR gamma chain. So maybe the third is gamma-delta T cells. 

So final answer:

Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, Natural Killer cells, Gamma-delta T cells.

Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, Natural Killer cells, Gamma-delta T cells
