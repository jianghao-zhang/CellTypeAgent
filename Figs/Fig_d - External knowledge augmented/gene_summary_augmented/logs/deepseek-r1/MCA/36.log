Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Sct: This gene encodes a member of the filamin family. The encoded protein interacts with glycoprotein Ib alpha as part of the process to repair vascular injuries. The platelet glycoprotein Ib complex includes glycoprotein Ib alpha, and it binds the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in this gene have been found in several conditions: atelosteogenesis type 1 and type 3; boomerang dysplasia; autosomal dominant Larsen syndrome; and spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]
- Rhox9: Gene ID not found
- Rhox6: Gene ID not found
- Ldoc1: The protein encoded by this gene contains a leucine zipper-like motif and a proline-rich region that shares marked similarity with an SH3-binding domain. The protein localizes to the nucleus and is down-regulated in some cancer cell lines. It is thought to regulate the transcriptional response mediated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The gene has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene whose protein product may have an important role in the development and/or progression of some cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Sin3b: Predicted to enable transcription corepressor activity. Predicted to be involved in histone deacetylation; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II; and striated muscle tissue development. Predicted to be located in nucleus. Predicted to be part of Sin3 complex. Predicted to be active in chromatin. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]
- Fthl17a: Gene ID not found
- Cdkn1c: This gene is imprinted, with preferential expression of the maternal allele. The encoded protein is a tight-binding, strong inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene are implicated in sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndorome, suggesting that this gene is a tumor suppressor candidate. Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2010]
- Gm9112: Gene ID not found
- Rhox5: Gene ID not found
- 3830417A13Rik: Gene ID not found

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Sct, Rhox9, Rhox6, Ldoc1, Sin3b, Fthl17a, Cdkn1c, Gm9112, Rhox5, and 3830417A13Rik. Let's go through each gene and see which cell types they are associated with.

First, Sct (Scleraxis) is a known marker for tendon and ligament cells. It's a transcription factor critical in the development of these tissues. So that's a strong indication for tendon/ligament cells.

Next, Rhox genes: Rhox5, Rhox6, Rhox9. These are part of the reproductive homeobox genes, primarily expressed in reproductive tissues. Specifically, Rhox5 is associated with male germ cells and the epididymis. Rhox6 and Rhox9 are also involved in reproductive tissues, so this points towards germ cells or cells in the reproductive system.

Cdkn1c is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, involved in cell cycle regulation. It's imprinted and maternally expressed. It's been linked to various tissues, including placental development and some neuronal cells. However, it's also expressed in certain stem cells and during development. But considering the other markers, maybe placental cells or some stem cell population?

Ldoc1 (Leucine Zipper Down-Regulated in Cancer 1) is mentioned as a tumor suppressor, downregulated in cancers. It's involved in NF-kappaB regulation. However, I'm not sure about its specific cell type association. Maybe immune cells? Or cells where NF-kappaB plays a role, like macrophages or lymphocytes? Not entirely certain here.

Sin3b is part of the Sin3/HDAC complex involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. It's broadly involved in many cell types, but maybe in cells requiring tight regulation of gene expression, like stem cells or certain differentiated cells.

Fthl17a and Gm9112: Gene IDs not found, so probably not useful here. Similarly, 3830417A13Rik is an RIKEN identifier without information, so might not contribute.

Putting this together: The strongest markers seem to be Sct (tendon/ligament) and the Rhox cluster (reproductive cells). Cdkn1c might point towards placental or embryonic cells. But combining Rhox genes, which are strongly reproductive, and Sct, maybe there's a mix here. Wait, but Scleraxis is very specific for tendon/ligament progenitor cells. However, Rhox genes are in reproductive tissues. Are there any cell types that co-express these? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the sample has a mix of cells? But the question is about the top 3 cell types for the given markers. 

Alternatively, maybe some of these genes are expressed in embryonic stem cells or progenitor cells. Cdkn1c is involved in development. Sin3b is involved in chromatin modification, which is important in stem cells. But Rhox5,6,9 are more specific to reproductive cells. Sct is tendon. So perhaps the top three would be:

1. Male germ cells (due to Rhox5,6,9)
2. Tendon/ligament cells (Sct)
3. Placental cells or embryonic stem cells (Cdkn1c, Sin3b)

Alternatively, considering Cdkn1c is also associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which involves overgrowth, perhaps placental cells. But I'm not sure. Another angle: Ldoc1 is downregulated in cancer, but that doesn't pinpoint a cell type. Maybe immune cells? Not sure.

Wait, Rhox genes (reproductive homeobox) are mainly expressed in the testis. For example, Rhox5 is expressed in Sertoli cells and germ cells. So perhaps Sertoli cells, germ cells, or other testicular cells. Then Sct is tendon. But how do these combine? Maybe the markers are from a mixed population. But the task is to pick the top 3 cell types. So if Rhox cluster is strongest, then testis-related cells would be first. Sct would be next. Cdkn1c might be placental or other embryonic cells. Alternatively, Cdkn1c is also expressed in certain neurons, but that's less likely with the other markers.

Alternatively, maybe embryonic stem cells, but Rhox genes are more specific to reproductive. Another possibility: The presence of Rhox genes (testis), Sct (tendon), and Cdkn1c (placenta) might indicate different lineages. But the question is the top 3 cell types. So perhaps:

1. Spermatogenic cells (Rhox genes)
2. Tendon cells (Sct)
3. Placental trophoblast cells (Cdkn1c)

Alternatively, maybe the presence of Rhox and Cdkn1c could point towards germ cells, as Cdkn1c is involved in cell cycle regulation in germ cells as well. Alternatively, maybe embryonic stem cells. But I need to check.

Wait, Cdkn1c (p57) is expressed in the placenta, and in certain stem cells. But in germ cells? Not sure. Rhox genes are definitely testis-specific. Sct is tendon. So perhaps the top three are:

1. Sertoli cells (Rhox5)
2. Spermatogonia (Rhox5, Rhox6, Rhox9)
3. Tendon cells (Sct)

But I need to confirm. Also, Cdkn1c is imprinted and involved in Beckwith-Wiedemann, which is a growth disorder, but its expression in germ cells? Maybe placental cells would be another option. Alternatively, maybe embryonic stem cells if Sin3b is involved in chromatin regulation. But Sin3b is part of the Sin3 complex, which is involved in many cell types.

Alternatively, combining Rhox genes (testis), Sct (tendon), and Cdkn1c (placenta), the top three cell types could be:

1. Male germ cells
2. Tendon cells
3. Placental cells

But I need to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple Rhox genes (Rhox5,6,9) strongly points towards male germ cells as the top, then Sct for tendon cells, and Cdkn1c maybe for placental or certain stem cells.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is:

1. Spermatogenic cells
2. Sertoli cells
3. Tendon cells

But I need to check if Rhox5 is in Sertoli or germ cells. From what I recall, Rhox5 is expressed in Sertoli cells and germ cells in the testis. So maybe "male germ cells" and "Sertoli cells" are separate, but if the markers include multiple Rhox genes, perhaps the strongest association is with germ cells. Alternatively, the testis as a tissue, but the question is about cell types.

Alternatively, maybe the top three are:

1. Sperm cells (germ cells)
2. Tendon cells
3. Placental trophoblasts

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The presence of Sct is very specific to tendon/ligament cells. Rhox genes are testis-specific, so male germ cells or Sertoli cells. Cdkn1c might be placental. Ldoc1 and Sin3b are less informative here. So the top three would likely be:

1. Male germ cells (due to Rhox5,6,9)
2. Tendon cells (Sct)
3. Placental cells (Cdkn1c)

That seems plausible. Alternatively, placental cells might not be in the top three, and maybe another cell type. But given the information, those are the most specific markers. So the answer would be: Male germ cells, Tendon cells, Placental trophoblast cells.
