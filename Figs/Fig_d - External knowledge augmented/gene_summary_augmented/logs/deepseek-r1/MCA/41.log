Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here go the summaries of Genes from the NCBI Gene database for your reference:
- Dppa3: This gene encodes a protein that in mice may function as a maternal factor during the preimplantation stage of development. In mice, this gene may play a role in transcriptional repression, cell division, and maintenance of cell pluripotentiality. In humans, related intronless loci are located on chromosomes 14 and X. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
- Dazl: The DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) gene family encodes potential RNA binding proteins that are expressed in prenatal and postnatal germ cells of males and females. The protein encoded by this gene is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm of fetal germ cells and to the cytoplasm of developing oocytes. In the testis, this protein is localized to the nucleus of spermatogonia but relocates to the cytoplasm during meiosis where it persists in spermatids and spermatozoa. Transposition and amplification of this autosomal gene during primate evolution gave rise to the DAZ gene cluster on the Y chromosome. Mutations in this gene have been linked to severe spermatogenic failure and infertility in males. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]
- Utf1: The protein encoded by this gene is a leucine zipper-containing transcriptional coactivator that may link the upstream activator ATF2 with the basal transcription complex. The encoded protein is closely associated with chromatin and is required for the proper differentiation of embryonic carcinoma and embryonic stem cells. Found nearly exclusively in pluripotent cells, this protein can also serve as a transcriptional repressor. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
- Dppa5a: Gene ID not found
- Fkbp6: The protein encoded by this gene is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that may function in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This gene is located in a chromosomal region that is deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome. Defects in this gene may cause male infertility. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene located nearby on chromosome 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
- Tex19.1: Gene ID not found
- Dppa4: This gene encodes a nuclear factor that is involved in the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells and essential for embryogenesis. The encoded protein has a scaffold-attachment factor A/B, acinus and PIAS (SAP) domain that binds DNA and is thought to modify chromatin. Mice with a homozygous knockout of the orthologous gene die during late embryonic development or within hours after birth. Knockout embryos are normal in size at embryonic day 18.5 but exhibit skeletal and lung tissue abnormalities. This gene, when mutated, is highly expressed in embryonal carcinomas, pluripotent germ cell tumors, and other cancers and is thought to play an important role in tumor progression. Multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2017]
- Cct8: This gene encodes the theta subunit of the CCT chaperonin, which is abundant in the eukaryotic cytosol and may be involved in the transport and assembly of newly synthesized proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene. A pseudogene related to this gene is located on chromosome 1. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]
- Rps4l: Summary not found
- Ifitm1: Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of interferon induced antiviral proteins. The family contains five members, including IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 that belong to the CD225 superfamily. The protein encoded by this gene restricts cellular entry by diverse viral pathogens, such as influenza A virus, Ebola virus and Sars-CoV-2. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2021]

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Dppa3, Dazl, Utf1, Dppa5a, Fkbp6, Tex19.1, Dppa4, Cct8, Rps4l, and Ifitm1. 

First, I need to recall what each of these genes typically marks. Let's go through them one by one using the provided summaries and my existing knowledge.

Starting with Dppa3: The summary mentions it's involved in preimplantation development, pluripotency, and is a maternal factor. Dppa3 is also known as Stella, which is a marker for primordial germ cells (PGCs) and early embryonic cells like embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

Dazl: The summary states it's expressed in germ cells of both males and females, involved in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Dazl is a germ cell marker, crucial for germ cell development.

Utf1: The encoded protein is associated with pluripotent cells (ESCs and embryonal carcinoma cells), acting as a transcriptional coactivator and repressor. Utf1 is a known pluripotency marker found in ESCs.

Dppa5a: The gene ID wasn't found, but I know Dppa5a is another pluripotency marker, often co-expressed with Dppa3 in germ cells and ESCs.

Fkbp6: The summary links it to male infertility and part of Williams-Beuren syndrome. Fkbp6 is involved in spermatogenesis, so likely a germ cell marker, specifically in male germ cells.

Tex19.1: Gene ID not found, but Tex19 is associated with germ cells, particularly spermatogonia and testicular germ cell tumors.

Dppa4: Similar to Dppa3 and Dppa5a, involved in pluripotency and embryogenesis. It's another pluripotency marker in ESCs and early embryos.

Cct8: A subunit of the chaperonin complex, involved in protein folding. This is a housekeeping gene but might be expressed in various cells, not specific.

Rps4l: Ribosomal protein, possibly a housekeeping gene as well. Not specific to any cell type.

Ifitm1: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein, involved in antiviral response. Expressed in various cells, including immune cells, but not specific to pluripotent or germ cells.

So, combining these: Dppa3, Dazl, Utf1, Dppa5a, Dppa4 are strong markers for pluripotent cells (like ESCs) and germ cells. Fkbp6 and Tex19.1 point towards germ cells, especially male germ cells. 

Pluripotent stem cells (ESCs or induced pluripotent stem cells) express Dppa3, Utf1, Dppa4, Dppa5a. Germ cells (primordial germ cells, oocytes, spermatogonia) express Dppa3, Dazl, Fkbp6, Tex19.1. 

Given that Dazl is specific to germ cells and not typically in ESCs, the presence of both pluripotency markers and germ cell markers suggests the cells could be germline cells, such as primordial germ cells or gamete precursors. However, some overlap exists; for example, ESCs might express Dppa3, Utf1, Dppa4, and Dppa5a. But Dazl and Fkbp6 are more germ cell-specific. 

So, the top three cell types would likely be:

1. Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) – because of Dppa3, Dazl, Utf1, Dppa5a, Dppa4, Fkbp6, Tex19.1.

2. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) – markers include Dppa3, Utf1, Dppa4, Dppa5a, but lack strong germ cell markers like Dazl.

3. Spermatogonia or male germ cells – due to Dazl, Fkbp6, Tex19.1, but also Dppa3 in early stages.

Alternatively, maybe oocytes? But Dazl is in both male and female germ cells. However, Fkbp6 is linked to male infertility, so maybe more towards male germ cells.

But since the question is about the top 3, the strongest would be:

1. Primordial Germ Cells (highest number of markers)

2. Embryonic Stem Cells (many pluripotency markers)

3. Spermatogonia (Dazl, Fkbp6, Tex19.1)

Wait, but Utf1 is also in ESCs. So maybe ESCs are second. Then third could be germ cells, but need to check. The combination of both pluripotency and germ cell markers might suggest germline stem cells or PGCs. So perhaps:

1. Primordial Germ Cells

2. Embryonic Stem Cells

3. Spermatogonia

Alternatively, if some markers are more specific. For example, Utf1 is in ESCs and embryonal carcinoma cells. Dppa3 is in PGCs and ESCs. Dazl is specific to germ cells. So if Dazl is present, that's a strong indicator for germ cells. So the presence of Dazl would push towards germ cells being the top. But then, if the markers include both pluripotency and germ cell, perhaps the cell type is germ cells with pluripotent features, like PGCs.

So ranking:

1. Primordial Germ Cells (Dppa3, Dazl, Utf1, Dppa5a, Dppa4, Fkbp6, Tex19.1)

2. Embryonic Stem Cells (Dppa3, Utf1, Dppa4, Dppa5a)

3. Spermatogonia (Dazl, Fkbp6, Tex19.1, maybe Dppa3 in early stages)

Alternatively, could it be germ cell tumor cells? The Dppa4 summary mentions embryonal carcinomas. But Utf1 is in those too. However, the user is asking for normal mouse cell types.

So final answer: Primordial Germ Cells, Embryonic Stem Cells, Spermatogonia. But need to check if any other cell types fit better. For example, oocytes might express Dazl and Dppa3. But Fkbp6 is more male. Tex19.1 is also in male germ cells. So Spermatogonia might be the third. Alternatively, male germ cells in general.

Another angle: Dppa3 is in PGCs and oocytes. Dazl is in germ cells. Utf1 in ESCs. So maybe the top three are:

1. Primordial Germ Cells

2. Embryonic Stem Cells

3. Spermatogonia

Yes, that seems plausible.
