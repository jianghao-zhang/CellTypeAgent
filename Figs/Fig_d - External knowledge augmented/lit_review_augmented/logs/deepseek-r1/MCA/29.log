Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Igfbp7, Mgp, Sparc, Tbx20, Postn, Slc16a2, Myl2, Sln, Myl3, Aspn.

First, I'll list out the markers and recall their associations. Igfbp7 is often seen in fibroblasts or certain epithelial cells. Mgp and Sparc are extracellular matrix proteins, common in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Tbx20 is a transcription factor important in heart development. Postn (periostin) and Aspn (asporin) are also ECM proteins, again pointing to fibroblasts or connective tissue cells. Slc16a2 is a thyroid hormone transporter, which might be in various cell types. Myl2, Myl3, and Sln are myosin light chains and sarcolipin, which are muscle-related, specifically cardiac or skeletal muscle.

Looking at the provided literature snippets: 

- The first PMC article mentions OPN, ASPN, POSTN, SPARC high in PDL tissue but not PDLFs. PDL is periodontal ligament, so maybe fibroblasts here, but the note says not PDLFs, so maybe other cells in the ligament. However, the markers here include POSTN, ASPN, SPARC, which might still relate to fibroblasts or other stromal cells.

- The second PMC article's Suppl section G shows athero-EC cells from murine heart expressing Myl2 and Myl3. Athero-EC might be endothelial cells with a specific phenotype, but Myl2 and Myl3 are typically in cardiomyocytes. Maybe a subtype of endothelial cells in the heart that have some muscle characteristics?

- The third PMC article's results mention non-significant changes in Myl2, Myl3, Sln, etc. This suggests these genes are present but not changing in their study context. Sln is sarcolipin, found in skeletal muscle and atria of the heart.

Putting this together: Myl2, Myl3, Sln are strong indicators of muscle cells, specifically cardiac muscle (cardiomyocytes) since Sln is more cardiac. Then, Postn, Aspn, Sparc, Mgp, Igfbp7 are often in fibroblasts or stromal cells. However, the literature mentioned PDL tissue (which has fibroblasts) but not PDLFs, which might be a conflicting point. Alternatively, maybe vascular smooth muscle cells or other mesenchymal cells. Tbx20 is a cardiac transcription factor, so that's another hint for cardiomyocytes. Slc16a2 could be in various cells, maybe thyroid-related, but not sure.

So possible cell types:

1. Cardiomyocytes: Due to Tbx20, Myl2, Myl3, Sln.

2. Fibroblasts (possibly cardiac or other): Postn, Aspn, Sparc, Mgp, Igfbp7.

3. Smooth muscle cells: Mgp, Sparc, Postn, but also Myl2 and Myl3 can be in smooth muscle. However, Myl2 and Myl3 are more typical for cardiac/skeletal. Alternatively, considering the second literature's mention of athero-EC (endothelial cells) with Myl2/Myl3, but ECs usually don't express those. Maybe a mixed phenotype?

Wait, but the user is asking for mouse cell types. Common markers:

- Cardiomyocytes: Tbx20, Myl2 (MYL2 is myosin light chain 2, ventricular), Myl3 (atrial), Sln (sarcolipin, atrial).

- Fibroblasts: Postn, Sparc, Aspn, Mgp, Igfbp7.

- Smooth muscle cells: Acta2, Myh11, but Mgp and Sparc can be there too. However, the presence of Tbx20 is more cardiac.

Third candidate could be smooth muscle, but maybe another type. Alternatively, considering the mention of athero-EC, maybe endothelial cells with some markers, but ECs usually have CD31, VWF. Alternatively, maybe a progenitor cell type?

Alternatively, maybe skeletal muscle? But Sln is more cardiac. Myl2 and Myl3 are also in skeletal, but Tbx20 is cardiac-specific.

So the top three:

1. Cardiomyocytes

2. Fibroblasts

3. Smooth muscle cells

But need to check if there's another cell type. The markers like Slc16a2 (thyroid hormone transporter) could be in various cells, but not sure if it's defining. Maybe thyroid follicular cells, but that's less likely. Alternatively, another stromal cell type. Alternatively, considering the first literature's PDL (periodontal ligament) cells, but they excluded PDLFs. Maybe osteoblasts? But Mgp and Sparc are also in bone. However, the combination here seems more fibroblast or smooth muscle.

Alternatively, maybe chondrocytes? Aspn is asporin, which is in cartilage. Mgp is in cartilage and bone. But Postn is more tendon/ligament. Hmm.

Wait, asporin (ASPN) is a cartilage matrix protein. So if Aspn is present, maybe chondrocytes. But then Postn and Sparc are in fibroblasts. So conflicting markers. This makes it tricky.

But given the user's instruction to use the markers and the literature provided (even though they say not to rely solely on them), perhaps the top three are:

1. Cardiomyocytes (due to Tbx20, Myl2, Myl3, Sln)

2. Fibroblasts (Postn, Aspn, Sparc, Mgp, Igfbp7)

3. Smooth muscle cells (Mgp, Sparc, Postn; but Myl2 and Myl3 could be present here as well. However, smooth muscle typically has MYH11, ACTA2. Maybe not enough here. Alternatively, considering cardiac fibroblasts as a separate category.

Alternatively, the third could be atrial cardiomyocytes specifically, but that's a subset of the first. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a type of stromal cell, like a cardiac fibroblast.

Alternatively, considering the literature snippet from PMC8517356 mentions Myl2, Myl3, Sln in a context where they didn't change, which could be in skeletal muscle, but again, Sln is more cardiac. 

Hmm. I think the most straightforward answer based on the markers would be:

1. Cardiomyocytes

2. Fibroblasts

3. Smooth muscle cells

But I need to check if there's a more specific cell type. For example, in heart, there are fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in vessels. So maybe cardiac fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle. But the user just wants the top 3 cell types, not their locations.

Alternatively, could the third be chondrocytes? But Aspn and Mgp are in cartilage, but other markers like Postn and Sparc are more fibroblast-related.

Alternatively, maybe osteoblasts? Mgp is matrix Gla protein, involved in bone. Sparc is osteonectin. But again, Postn is more ligament. 

This is a bit conflicting, but given the combination, I think the top three are:

Cardiomyocytes, Fibroblasts, Smooth Muscle Cells. 

But maybe the third is another type. Alternatively, considering that some markers like Slc16a2 (which is a thyroid hormone transporter) might be present in certain cells. For example, Slc16a2 is also known as MCT8, expressed in endothelial cells, astrocytes, and others. But with the other markers, not sure. 

Alternatively, considering that in the second literature, athero-EC (endothelial cells) express Myl2 and Myl3, which is unusual. But ECs don't typically express those. Maybe a specific subtype, but that might not be a common cell type. 

Given all this, I'll go with:

1. Cardiomyocytes

2. Fibroblasts

3. Smooth muscle cells
