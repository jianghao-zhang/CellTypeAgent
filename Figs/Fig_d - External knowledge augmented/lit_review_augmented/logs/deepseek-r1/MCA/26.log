Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Kap, Miox, Aldob, Akr1c21, Fxyd2, Gsta2, Gpx3, Rida, Ass1, Keg1. The answer needs to be a comma-separated list ranked by probability.

First, I need to recall what these markers typically indicate. Let's look at each one:

- Kap: Also known as Kidney androgen-regulated protein. This is specific to kidney proximal tubule cells.
- Miox: Myo-inositol oxygenase, another marker for proximal tubule cells in the kidney.
- Aldob: Aldolase B, found in liver, kidney, and intestine. In kidney, it's associated with proximal tubules.
- Akr1c21: Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C21. This might be involved in steroid metabolism, possibly in liver or kidney.
- Fxyd2: Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gamma. Found in kidney distal tubules, but some isoforms might be in proximal.
- Gsta2: Glutathione S-transferase alpha 2. Expressed in liver and kidney.
- Gpx3: Glutathione peroxidase 3. Found in kidney, especially proximal tubules.
- Rida: Reactive intermediate imine deaminase A. Not sure, maybe liver or kidney.
- Ass1: Argininosuccinate synthase 1. Involved in urea cycle, found in liver, but also in kidney.
- Keg1: Not familiar. Maybe a typo? Could it be Krt18? Not sure. Might need to check literature.

Looking at the provided references:

In PMC11249042, they list Kap, Miox, Aldob, Fxyd2, Gsta2 as markers flagged for native cell types, especially kidney proximal tubule cells. The methods section mentions these genes are expected in native cell types, likely proximal tubule.

PMC7306052 mentions proximal hPTEC (human proximal tubular epithelial cells) with MIOX, ALDOB, ASS1, GPX3. So these are markers for proximal tubule cells.

PMC7043045 links GPX3, MIOX, ALDOB to glutathione metabolism and oxidation-reduction in kidney-related pathways.

Putting this together, the markers Kap, Miox, Aldob, Gsta2, Gpx3, Ass1 are all pointing towards proximal tubule cells in the kidney. Fxyd2 is sometimes in distal tubules, but in the context of the other markers, maybe it's part of the proximal here. Akr1c21 might be related to liver, but since most markers are kidney, maybe it's a subpopulation. 

The top cell type is definitely proximal tubule epithelial cells. Then, maybe liver hepatocytes? But the majority are kidney markers. Another possibility is distal tubule, but the key markers here are more proximal. Alternatively, maybe collecting duct cells? But not sure. Wait, the user is asking for mouse cells. In mouse kidney, these markers are specific to proximal tubules. The other possibility is liver cells, but without more liver-specific markers like Alb, Cyp enzymes, etc., it's less likely.

So, the top three would be:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells (most markers)
2. Hepatocytes (some markers like Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1 are in liver, but not as dominant)
3. Maybe distal tubule epithelial cells (Fxyd2), but considering the literature mentions proximal for most markers, perhaps the second and third are other kidney cells or other cell types. Wait, maybe the second is liver hepatocyte and third is intestinal epithelial cells? Aldob is in intestine too, but other markers not so much. Alternatively, maybe collecting duct cells?

Alternatively, maybe all three are different parts of the nephron. But given that the majority of markers are proximal tubule, the next ones could be other kidney cells but less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects liver and kidney as top two. Wait, but the first literature explicitly mentions these markers in native cell types expected (proximal tubule). The second reference is about proximal tubule. The third also links some markers to kidney. So, the top three would all be kidney-related. 

Wait, but the question is about mouse cells. Are there other cell types in mouse that express these markers? For example, Akr1c21 might be in other tissues. Let me check Akr1c21. Akr1c21 is involved in steroid hormone metabolism, possibly in liver or testis. However, since most other markers are kidney, maybe the cell type is still proximal tubule. The user says "the higher the probability, the further left", so even if there's a marker that's in another cell type, the majority would determine the primary cell type.

So the top three are:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes (since Aldob, Ass1, Gsta2, Gpx3 are in liver)
3. Intestinal epithelial cells (Aldob is there, but not others)

But wait, the literature in PMC7306052 mentions hPTEC (proximal tubule) with MIOX, ALDOB, ASS1, GPX3. So these are all in proximal tubule. So maybe all the markers are pointing to proximal tubule. Then why the user's question? Maybe they want to see if there's a mix. But the markers Kap and Miox are very specific to proximal tubule. So the top three would all be variations within kidney cells? Or maybe the user expects other cell types. Wait, in the given problem, the markers are a mix, but literature suggests proximal tubule. The other possibility is that some markers like Akr1c21 and Keg1 (unknown) might hint at another cell type, but without more info, the safest is to list proximal tubule as first, then perhaps hepatocytes, then maybe another kidney cell type like distal tubule or collecting duct. But since Fxyd2 is in distal, but the majority are proximal, maybe proximal is first, then hepatocytes, then distal tubule. Alternatively, maybe the answer is all three are proximal tubule. But the user asks for top 3 cell types. So perhaps:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Distal tubule epithelial cells

But the confidence for 2 and 3 would be lower. Alternatively, other kidney cells like podocytes or loop of Henle, but those have different markers. 

Alternatively, check if any of the other markers point elsewhere. For example, Gsta2 is in liver and kidney. Ass1 is in liver (urea cycle) but also kidney. Akr1c21 might be in liver. So perhaps hepatocytes are second. But the majority of markers are kidney. So the top three would be:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Intestinal epithelial cells

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer expects only proximal tubule as the first, and the other two are less certain. Alternatively, maybe collecting duct cells. 

Alternatively, since the user provided markers that are mostly kidney proximal tubule, but maybe there's another cell type with some overlap. For example, Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), but that's unlikely. 

Given the information, the most confident is proximal tubule epithelial cells. The other two might be hepatocytes and maybe another kidney cell type. But without more info, the safest is to list the top three as all kidney-related. However, the user might expect liver as second. 

So, based on the markers and references, the top three cell types are:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Distal tubule epithelial cells

But I need to check the markers again. Fxyd2 is in distal tubule. So if Fxyd2 is a key marker for distal, then maybe distal tubule is second. But the presence of multiple proximal markers (Kap, Miox, Aldob, Gsta2, Gpx3, Ass1) makes proximal tubule the clear first. Then, with Fxyd2, maybe distal tubule is second. But hepatocytes have Aldob, Ass1, Gsta2, Gpx3. 

So the conflict is between hepatocytes and distal tubule. Since the user is asking for mouse cells, and the markers like Akr1c21 (liver) might suggest hepatocytes, but Fxyd2 is kidney. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is three different kidney cell types. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is hepatocytes, third is intestinal epithelial cells. But without more intestinal markers, that's a stretch. 

Given the literature provided, the first reference mentions Kap, Miox, Aldob, Fxyd2, Gsta2 as expected in native cell types (proximal tubule). The second reference also links MIOX, ALDOB, ASS1, GPX3 to proximal tubule. The third links GPX3, MIOX, ALDOB to glutathione metabolism in kidney. So all point to proximal tubule. 

Therefore, the top three cell types could all be proximal tubule epithelial cells, but that's not possible. The user wants three different cell types. So perhaps:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes
3. Distal tubule epithelial cells

But I need to verify if any of the other markers are specific. For example, Akr1c21: looking it up, Akr1c21 is a mouse-specific aldo-keto reductase, expressed in liver and kidney. So in liver, Akr1c21 is present. So if a cell has Akr1c21 along with Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1, Gpx3, that could indicate hepatocytes. But Kap and Miox are kidney-specific. So how can a cell have both? Unless it's a mixed population, but the question is about individual cell types. So maybe some markers are co-expressed in certain contexts. 

Alternatively, the presence of Kap and Miox strongly indicates kidney proximal tubule. The other markers could be present there as well. For example, Ass1 in proximal tubule. So perhaps all markers are part of proximal tubule, making it the only cell type. But the user asks for top 3. Maybe the answer is only proximal tubule as the first, and the others are less likely. But the user says top 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the markers are a mix of proximal tubule and hepatocytes, but the presence of Kap and Miox (specific to kidney) makes proximal tubule the top. The other markers could be in hepatocytes, so hepatocytes would be second. Third could be another kidney cell type like distal tubule. 

So, considering all, the answer is:

Proximal tubule epithelial cells, Hepatocytes, Distal tubule epithelial cells

But I need to check if Distal tubule is correct. Fxyd2 is in distal tubule. So if a cell has Fxyd2 but not the other markers, it's distal. But here, Fxyd2 is present along with proximal markers, but maybe in some cells. However, the question is about the most likely cell types given all markers. So the presence of both proximal and distal markers might suggest a mix, but cell types are individual. Therefore, perhaps the primary is proximal tubule, and the others are lower. 

Alternatively, maybe the markers are from a single cell type (proximal tubule), so the top three would all be the same, but the user wants three different. That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe some markers are present in other cell types. For example, Aldob is in liver and kidney. So if a cell has Aldob, Akr1c21, Gsta2, Ass1, Gpx3, but not Kap or Miox, it's hepatocyte. But in this case, Kap and Miox are present, so it's kidney. 

Therefore, the only cell type with all these markers is proximal tubule. The other cell types would have subsets. So the top three would be:

1. Proximal tubule epithelial cells
2. Hepatocytes (has Aldob, Gsta2, Ass1, Gpx3, Akr1c21)
3. Intestinal epithelial cells (Aldob), but not others.

Alternatively, maybe the third is another kidney cell type, like loop of Henle or collecting duct. But without specific markers for those, it's hard to say. 

Given the information, the top three are most likely:

Proximal tubule epithelial cells, Hepatocytes, Distal tubule epithelial cells
