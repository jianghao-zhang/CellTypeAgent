content: In this CYP11A1-group, we found all genes, with the notable exception of HSD3B1, involved in the biosynthesis of pregnenolone and androstenedione: STAR, CYP11A1 (+FDX1/FDXR), CYP17A1 (+CYB5A/CYB5R3 + POR) (, see Appendix A).

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 cell types of mouse cells based on these markers: Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Akr1cl, Aldh1a1, Fdx1, Acsbg1, Star, Mgarp, Me1.

First, I remember that steroidogenic enzymes are often markers for certain endocrine cells. Looking at the markers, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1, and Star are all involved in steroid hormone synthesis. From the literature snippets provided, these genes (Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1) are mentioned in the context of steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells, Leydig cells, and possibly others. 

Leydig cells in the testes are known for producing testosterone, and they typically express Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, and Cyp17a1. The literature mentions fetal Leydig cells in the context of testosterone synthesis. Granulosa cells in the ovaries also produce steroids, and the second PMC reference talks about ovarian granulosa cells having those markers. Adrenal cortex cells, like those in the zona fasciculata or reticularis, might also express some of these enzymes, especially Cyp17a1 and Cyp11a1 for cortisol or androgens. 

Akr1cl is aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C-like, which might be involved in steroid metabolism. Aldh1a1 is aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1, which could relate to retinoic acid synthesis or other processes. Fdx1 is involved in electron transfer to cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are critical in steroidogenesis. Acsbg1 is acyl-CoA synthetase bubblegum family member 1, possibly involved in lipid metabolism. Mgarp is mitochondria-localized glutamic acid-rich protein, maybe related to mitochondrial function in steroid-producing cells. Me1 is malic enzyme 1, which provides NADPH for biosynthetic processes, including steroid synthesis.

Putting this together, the strongest indicators are the steroidogenic enzymes. Leydig cells (testis) and granulosa cells (ovary) are prime candidates. Adrenocortical cells (adrenal gland) might be third. Since the markers include multiple Leydig cell-specific genes like Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, and Star, Leydig cells are probably first. Granulosa cells also express Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, and Cyp17a1, as per the literature. Adrenal cortex cells might express some of these but maybe not all. Akr1cl and Aldh1a1 could be present in other steroidogenic cells too. So the top three are likely Leydig cells, Granulosa cells, and Adrenocortical cells.
