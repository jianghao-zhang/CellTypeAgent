Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to figure out the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are S100a6, Timp1, Cxcl5, Gm15772, Spp1, Lgals1, Gm28438, S100a4, Gm15459, Tm4sf1.

First, I'll recall what each of these markers typically indicate. S100a6 and S100a4 are part of the S100 calcium-binding protein family. These are often associated with various cell types, including immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as some epithelial cells. Timp1 is a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, which can be expressed by stromal cells and immune cells. Spp1 is Osteopontin, which is commonly found in macrophages, especially in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Lgals1 is Galectin-1, involved in immune regulation and found in T cells, macrophages, and some cancer cells. Cxcl5 is a chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment, so maybe neutrophils or cells that secrete chemokines.

Looking at the literature snippets provided: The second one (PMC11338192) mentions TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages) with markers including Lyz2, Chil3, S100a6, Spp1, Timp1. So Spp1, Timp1, and S100a6 are in TAMs. The third literature (PMC11112628) mentions immune-related genes like S100A6, TIMP1, S100A4, SPP1 upregulated in metastasis, which again points to immune cells, possibly macrophages. The first literature (PMC10449247) notes decreased expression of S100A4, LGALS1, and S100A6, but without context, it's hard to tell, but those markers might be relevant in whatever cell type they're studying.

Putting this together, TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages) are a strong candidate because multiple markers (S100a6, Spp1, Timp1) are listed in their markers. Spp1 is a key marker for macrophages. Lgals1 is also associated with macrophages and T cells. Cxcl5 might point to neutrophils or epithelial cells, but since other markers like S100a6 and Timp1 are more macrophage-related, maybe the primary cell type here is macrophages.

Other possibilities: Fibroblasts sometimes express S100a4 and Timp1, but Spp1 and S100a6 are more macrophage. Epithelial cells can have some S100 proteins, but again, the combination here leans towards immune cells. Maybe T cells? Lgals1 can be in T cells, but other markers like Spp1 are not typical for T cells. 

Another thought: Tumor cells themselves might express some of these markers, but the presence of Spp1 and Timp1 in TAMs makes me think macrophages are more likely. Let's list the top three:

1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) - multiple markers match.
2. Macrophages (general) - if not TAMs specifically.
3. Maybe fibroblasts or neutrophils, but given the markers, perhaps dendritic cells? Or another immune cell type. Alternatively, neutrophils with Cxcl5, but other markers are more macrophage. 

Wait, Tm4sf1 is a marker that's associated with endothelial cells or some cancer cells. But the other markers are stronger for macrophages. So maybe the third could be dendritic cells? Or maybe cancer-associated fibroblasts? Let me check: S100a4 is also known as FSP1, which is a fibroblast marker. So if S100a4 is present, maybe fibroblasts. But in the literature provided, S100a4 is mentioned in the context of immune system genes. Hmm. The first literature says S100A4, LGALS1, S100A6 were decreased, but in what context? Not sure. But the second literature includes S100a6 and Spp1 in TAMs. 

So the combination of Spp1, S100a6, Timp1, Lgals1 points towards macrophages. Cxcl5 might be a secondary marker here. Tm4sf1 could be in endothelial cells, but not sure. Given the strongest markers, the top three cell types are likely:

1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
2. Macrophages
3. Fibroblasts (due to S100a4 and Timp1) or possibly dendritic cells? Or neutrophils? Alternatively, cancer-associated fibroblasts.

But since the user wants the top 3, ordered by probability. Since TAMs are a subset of macrophages, maybe the first is TAMs, second general macrophages, third perhaps fibroblasts. Alternatively, if the markers are specific for TAMs, then maybe TAMs, other macrophages, then maybe another immune cell type. Alternatively, considering Cxcl5 is a chemokine for neutrophils, perhaps neutrophils are third. But I'm not sure if Cxcl5 is expressed by neutrophils themselves or by other cells recruiting them. Usually, cells like epithelial or macrophages produce Cxcl5 to attract neutrophils. So if Cxcl5 is a marker here, maybe the cell type is not neutrophil but the ones producing it. So that might still support macrophages. 

In the given literature, the TAMs markers include S100a6, Spp1, Timp1. So TAMs are the top. Then conventional macrophages. Third, maybe dendritic cells? Or fibroblasts. S100a4 is in fibroblasts (FSP1), so if that's a key marker here, maybe fibroblasts. But Spp1 is more macrophage. So perhaps the third is fibroblasts. Alternatively, epithelial cells. But without epithelial markers like keratin, less likely. 

So compiling all, the top 3 would be:

Tumor-associated macrophages, Macrophages, Fibroblasts.

But wait, maybe in terms of cell types, TAMs are a type of macrophage, so maybe the answer is Macrophages (including TAMs), then fibroblasts, then perhaps another type like dendritic cells or neutrophils. Alternatively, if the question expects more specific types, TAMs first, then conventional macrophages, then maybe dendritic cells or fibroblasts. Alternatively, if the markers point to TAMs, then another immune cell type like dendritic cells and fibroblasts. But I'm not certain. Let me check the markers again:

S100a6: Macrophages, dendritic cells, some epithelial cells.

Timp1: Macrophages, fibroblasts.

Cxcl5: Epithelial cells, macrophages.

Gm15772: unknown (maybe a pseudogene or not well-characterized).

Spp1: Macrophages, especially TAMs.

Lgals1: T cells, macrophages, cancer cells.

Gm28438: unknown.

S100a4: Fibroblasts, macrophages, cancer cells.

Gm15459: unknown.

Tm4sf1: Endothelial cells, cancer cells.

So combining these, the strongest signals are macrophages (Spp1, S100a6, Timp1, Lgals1, S100a4). Fibroblasts (S100a4, Timp1). Endothelial (Tm4sf1). But Tm4sf1 is only one marker. So maybe top 3:

1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
2. Macrophages
3. Fibroblasts

Alternatively, if Tm4sf1 is more prominent in endothelial cells, but without other endothelial markers, maybe fibroblasts are more likely. So the answer would be:

Tumor-associated macrophages, Macrophages, Fibroblasts.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), Macrophages, Fibroblasts
