content: We then examined rank correlation statistics between protein expression of DDX3Y compared to that of human orthologs of top male-biased primary granules genes from our mouse RNA-seq data (i.e. ELANE, MPO, PRTN3 and CTSG).

content: As per the HPA data, AZU1, DEFA1, PRTN3, CTSG, ELANE, MPO, LTF, MMP9, S100A8 and S100A9 are bone marrow and lymphoid tissue specific or enriched proteins suggesting that the expression of these proteins detected in our data is from immune cells.

Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types for these mouse markers. The markers given are Prtn3, Cmtm7, H2afy, Mpo, Plac8, Ctsg, Emb, Gmfg, Ptprcap, AI662270.

First, I remember that MPO (myeloperoxidase) is a common marker for neutrophils and other granulocytes. PRTN3 is proteinase 3, which I've seen associated with neutrophils and myeloid cells. CTSG (cathepsin G) is another granule protein found in neutrophils. Looking at the literature snippets provided, they mention PRTN3, CTSG, MPO, and PLAC8 in the context of neutrophil activation and defend response to pathogens. For example, in PMC8335717, these markers are used in calculating neutrophil activation scores. Similarly, PMC8425468 mentions PRTN3, MPO, and CTSG as male-biased primary granules genes, which are likely in neutrophils. PMC9853450 also lists PRTN3, CTSG, MPO as specific to bone marrow and immune cells, again pointing to neutrophils.

PLAC8 is mentioned in the DRP score and neutrophil activation, which might relate to myeloid cells. CMTM7 is a less familiar marker, but some quick recall suggests it might be involved in immune cells. H2afy is a histone variant, maybe related to cell proliferation, but not specific. Ptprcap is CD45R, a common leukocyte marker. Emb and Gmfg I'm not sure about, but AI662270 is an unknown gene symbol, possibly a placeholder or less studied.

So, considering the strong presence of MPO, PRTN3, CTSG, and PLAC8, the primary cell type here is likely neutrophils. Next, other myeloid cells like granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) might come into play since the first literature mentions GMP cells in the DRP score. Additionally, monocytes or macrophages could be a possibility, but the markers like MPO and PRTN3 are more specific to neutrophils. Another possibility is bone marrow cells, given the mention in the third literature about bone marrow specific proteins.

Putting it all together: Neutrophils are the top, followed by Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitors (GMP), and then maybe Monocytes. Alternatively, maybe myeloid cells in general. But since the markers are strongly neutrophil-related, the top three would be Neutrophil, GMP, and perhaps Myeloid cells.

Wait, but GMP is a progenitor cell type. So the hierarchy might be Neutrophils first, then maybe Myeloblasts or promyelocytes, but perhaps in the context of the literature, GMP is considered. Alternatively, the second could be Myeloid cells, but I need to check the exact terms used. The first literature mentions GMP cells, so GMP is a progenitor cell type. The third cell type might be Monocytes, but PLAC8 is also seen in some monocyte subsets. Alternatively, considering H2afy and Ptprcap, maybe stem cells? Hmm, but those are more general. Given the markers, the strongest indicators are for neutrophils and their progenitors. So, the top three cell types are likely Neutrophil, Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor (GMP), and possibly Myeloid cells or Monocytes. However, since the user wants the top three, the most probable based on the markers would be Neutrophil, then GMP, then maybe Myeloblast or another myeloid progenitor. Alternatively, if considering the DRP score from the first paper, which is for GMP, but the markers there include PRTN3, CTSG, MPO, PLAC8, which are in the given list. So GMP is a strong candidate. Then the third could be Monocytes, as some markers like PLAC8 and CMTM7 might be expressed there. Alternatively, looking at the third literature, which mentions bone marrow and lymphoid tissue specific proteins, maybe Bone Marrow Cells, but that's a tissue rather than a cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe Myeloid cells as a broader category. But the question is specific cell types. So, likely the top three are Neutrophil, Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor, and Monocyte. But I need to confirm if the markers align. For example, PLAC8 is also in some T cells, but the context here is more myeloid. H2afy (macroH2A) might be in stem cells, but not sure. CMTM7 is involved in immune cells, maybe macrophages. However, given the prominence of PRTN3, MPO, CTSG, which are neutrophil primary granules, the strongest is Neutrophil. GMP cells are progenitors that give rise to neutrophils and monocytes, so those markers would be present in GMP. Then, maybe Monocytes as a third, as some markers like PLAC8 and others might be expressed. Alternatively, Myeloblast, but that's a more specific progenitor. 

Alternatively, looking at the markers, maybe the third is a hematopoietic stem cell? But the presence of MPO would suggest more differentiated cells. So, the list is Neutrophil, Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor (GMP), and Monocyte. Alternatively, since the first literature's DRP score includes GMP, and the markers in the query include several of those (PRTN3, CTSG, MPO, PLAC8), GMP is second. Then the third could be Myeloid Cells, but that's a broad category. Alternatively, if H2afy is involved in stem cells, but I don't have info on that. 

Another angle: Ptprcap is CD45 antigen, which is a pan-leukocyte marker, so not specific. Emb is embigin, which is in various cells. Gmfg is a granulocyte marker. So Gmfg might support granulocytes. 

Putting it all together, the top three cell types are most likely:

1. Neutrophil
2. Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor (GMP)
3. Monocyte

Alternatively, if the third is not Monocyte, maybe Myeloid Cells. But considering the markers, Monocytes do express some of these genes, but maybe not as strongly as neutrophils. Alternatively, the third could be Myeloblast. However, given the literature mentions GMP and neutrophil activation, I'll go with Neutrophil, GMP, and Monocyte.
