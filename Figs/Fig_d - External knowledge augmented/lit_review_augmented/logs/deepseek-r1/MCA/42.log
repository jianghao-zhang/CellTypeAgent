Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top 3 cell types for mouse cells based on the given markers. The markers are Gzma, Ccl5, Gzmb, Cd7, Rgs1, AW112010, Cd3g, Nkg7, Cd8a, Tcrg-C2.

First, I remember that Cd3g and Cd8a are classic T cell markers. Cd3 is part of the T cell receptor complex, so Cd3g would indicate T cells. Cd8a is specific for CD8+ T cells, which are cytotoxic T cells. Then there's Gzma and Gzmb, which are granzymes. Those are involved in killing target cells, so they're also associated with cytotoxic T cells or NK cells. 

Ccl5 is a chemokine that's produced by T cells and NK cells. Nkg7 is a gene I've heard is expressed in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells. Cd7 is another marker that's found on T cells and NK cells. Tcrg-C2 likely refers to the T cell receptor gamma chain, which is part of the TCR complex in T cells, specifically gamma delta T cells maybe. 

Rgs1 is a regulator of G-protein signaling, which might be expressed in activated T cells or other immune cells. AW112010 is a gene I'm not as familiar with, but maybe it's associated with immune cells as well. 

Looking at the literature snippets provided: the first PMC article mentions Cd8a, Cd3g, Ccl5, Gzma, Gzmb, Rgs1, Nkg7, Cd7, and Fcer1g as part of R1_1. The second article talks about T cells, specifically CD8+ T cells, using markers like Cd3g, Gzma, Gzmb, Cd8a, Tcrg, and Ccl5. The third PMC article lists markers including Gzma, Gzmb, Ccl5, Cd7, Cd3g, and Cd8a as immune cell markers, particularly for intestinal immune cells.

Putting this together, the markers point towards T cells, especially CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The presence of TCR genes (Tcrg-C2) and CD3g solidify that. However, some markers like Nkg7 and Cd7 are also found in NK cells. But since there's Cd8a and Tcrg, which are more specific to T cells, the primary cell type here is CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. NK cells could be a possibility too, but probably secondary. Maybe the third could be gamma delta T cells because of Tcrg, but that might be a subset of T cells. Alternatively, activated T cells since Rgs1 and others are involved in activation.

Wait, but the question is top 3 cell types. So the primary is CD8+ T cells. Then NK cells might be next because of Nkg7 and Gzma/Gzmb. Then maybe gamma delta T cells because of Tcrg-C2. Alternatively, maybe another T cell subtype. Let me check: Cd8a is CD8+ T cells, Tcrg is gamma chain, which is part of gamma delta T cells. But CD8+ T cells are usually alpha beta T cells. Gamma delta T cells are a different subset. So if Tcrg is present, maybe gamma delta T cells. But Cd8a is more alpha beta. However, sometimes gamma delta T cells can express CD8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the markers are a mix, but the main markers like Cd3g, Cd8a, Cd7, and the granzymes point to cytotoxic T cells. So the top 3 would be CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and maybe gamma delta T cells. But I need to check the literature mentions again. The second PMC article specifically mentions CD8+ T cells. The first PMC's R1_1 cluster includes those markers as T cell-specific. So the first is CD8+ T cells. Then NK cells might be next. Alternatively, maybe NKT cells, but I'm not sure. Let's see: Nkg7 is expressed in both NK and CD8+ T cells. Cd7 is on T and NK cells. The combination might lean more towards T cells, but some markers are shared. However, the presence of Tcrg-C2 (T cell receptor gamma) suggests gamma delta T cells. But CD8a is usually alpha beta. So perhaps the top three are: 1. CD8+ T cells, 2. Gamma delta T cells, 3. NK cells. But I need to confirm the usual markers. Gamma delta T cells express TCR gamma and delta chains, not CD8 necessarily. So maybe in this case, Tcrg-C2 would indicate gamma delta T cells. But Cd8a is present. Wait, but some gamma delta T cells can be CD8+. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both CD8a and Tcrg suggests a mix. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as the first, then NK cells, then maybe activated T cells or memory T cells. The Rgs1 gene is associated with T cell activation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the markers: Cd3g (T cell), Cd8a (CD8+ T), Tcrg (gamma delta T), so maybe gamma delta T cells are a separate type. But CD8+ T cells are alpha beta. So maybe the top three are CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and gamma delta T cells. That's possible. Let me check the markers again. The presence of both Cd8a and Tcrg-C2 could mean two subsets: CD8+ alpha beta T cells and gamma delta T cells. But in that case, how do the markers rank? The literature mentions CD8+ T cells as the main one. The other PMCs mention T cells in general. So the top cell type is CD8+ T cells. Then NK cells, as they share some markers (Gzmb, Gzma, Nkg7). Then gamma delta T cells. Alternatively, maybe the third is another subset, like effector memory T cells. But I'm not sure. So based on the markers given, the most likely top three would be:

1. CD8+ T cells (because of Cd8a, Cd3g, Gzma/b, Ccl5, Tcrg-C2)
2. Natural Killer (NK) cells (Nkg7, Gzma/b, Ccl5, Cd7)
3. Gamma delta T cells (Tcrg-C2, Cd3g, Cd8a?)

But wait, gamma delta T cells typically don't express Cd8a as much. Maybe the presence of Cd8a here complicates things. Alternatively, maybe it's a mix. Alternatively, the third could be mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe activated CD8+ T cells. Maybe the Rgs1 is a sign of activation. 

Alternatively, since Cd7 is also a marker for T cells and NK cells, but more so T cells. The presence of Cd3g and Cd8a is strong for T cells. So the first is CD8+ T cells. NK cells would have Nkg7, Gzma/b, Ccl5, Cd7 but lack Cd3g and Cd8a. However, in the given markers, Cd3g and Cd8a are present, so the main cell type is CD8+ T. Then maybe NK cells are next, but maybe the presence of T cell markers makes NK less likely. Wait, but in the literature, the second PMC mentions that the genes are T cell-specific. So maybe NK cells aren't the second. But Nkg7 is a marker for NK cells. Maybe in this case, the cell type is CD8+ T cells, then gamma delta T cells, then NK cells. Alternatively, maybe the markers are overlapping. 

Alternatively, another approach: look up each marker's association.

- Cd3g: T cells
- Cd8a: CD8+ T cells
- Tcrg-C2: T cell receptor gamma chain, so gamma delta T cells
- Gzma, Gzmb: cytotoxic cells (CD8+ T, NK, gamma delta T)
- Ccl5: produced by T cells and NK cells
- Nkg7: expressed in NK and CD8+ T cells
- Cd7: T and NK cells
- Rgs1: activated T cells?
- AW112010: not sure, but maybe an immune-related gene.

So putting this together, the primary is CD8+ T cells (Cd8a, Cd3g, Tcrg-C2 might be part of the TCR?), but wait, CD8+ T cells are usually alpha beta T cells. The Tcrg is gamma chain, which is part of gamma delta TCR. So maybe there's a mix here. But Cd8a is typically alpha beta. Hmm, maybe the cell has both? Unlikely. Maybe the data is from a population with multiple cell types. But the question is about the top 3 cell types for cells expressing all these markers. But in reality, a single cell wouldn't express both alpha beta and gamma delta TCR. So perhaps this is a list of markers from a cluster that includes multiple cells. But the task is to determine the most likely cell types based on the markers provided. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a CD8+ gamma delta T cell, but that's less common. Alternatively, some activated CD8+ T cells might express more granzymes and other markers. 

Given that, the top three cell types would be:

1. CD8+ T cells (most markers align here)
2. Gamma delta T cells (due to Tcrg-C2)
3. Natural Killer cells (due to Nkg7, Gzma/b, Ccl5)

Alternatively, if the Tcrg-C2 is part of the same cell as Cd8a, which is conflicting, maybe Gamma delta T cells are not the second. Wait, but gamma delta T cells can sometimes express CD8, but more commonly CD8 is on alpha beta T cells. So perhaps the presence of Cd8a and Tcrg-C2 might indicate two different cell types. But since the task is to consider all markers together, maybe the answer is:

1. CD8+ T cells
2. Gamma delta T cells
3. NK cells

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the literature again. The second PMC article mentions that the markers (including Tcrg) are part of T cell-specific genes, and they mention CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ T cells. So Tcrg might be a part of CD8+ T cells here? Wait, but TCR gamma is part of gamma delta T cells, not alpha beta. So maybe the presence of both Cd8a and Tcrg suggests two different cell types. However, in the context of the problem, the markers are from a single cell or a cluster. If it's a cluster, maybe it's a mix of CD8+ T cells and gamma delta T cells. But the question is about the top 3 cell types. 

Alternatively, perhaps the cell type is a cytotoxic T cell (CD8+), then NK, then gamma delta. Given the markers, I'll go with:

1. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
2. Natural Killer cells
3. Gamma delta T cells
