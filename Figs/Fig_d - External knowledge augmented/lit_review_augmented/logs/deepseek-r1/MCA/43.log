<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes: Kctd14, Lgals7, Gng13, Bmyc, Ifitm1, Gstm2, Laptm4b, Amhr2, Wnt6, Ldhb. The answer should list the cell types in order of probability, from highest to lowest, separated by commas.

First, I need to recall or look up what each of these markers typically signifies in terms of cell types. But since the user provided some literature excerpts, I should check those for mentions of these genes.

Looking at the first literature segment (PMCID: PMC10705884), it mentions that AMHR2, GNG13, and WNT6 are granulosa cell (GC)-specific genes. So that's a strong indication that if these markers are present, granulosa cells might be a candidate. The second literature (PMCID: PMC11503257) also notes that PG cells (which I think are pre-granulosa cells) express Amhr2 and Wnt6. So this reinforces the connection to granulosa cells or related cell types.

The second literature also mentions that PG cells (clusters 3 and 7) have Fst, Kitl, Amhr2, and Wnt6. So Amhr2 and Wnt6 are markers here. Additionally, the first paper's GC-specific genes include GNG13, AMHR2, and WNT6. So combining these, granulosa cells or PG cells (pre-granulosa) are likely.

Now, looking at the other markers: Ifitm1 and Laptm4b. The third literature (PMCID: PMC10776410) lists IFITM1 and LAPTM4B as part of genes implicated in CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) or related to cell adhesion, signaling, etc. This might suggest immune or blood cells, but the other markers don't align as much. However, Ifitm1 is also known in some stem cells or germ cells. But given the other markers like Amhr2 and Wnt6 pointing to granulosa, maybe these are part of a broader set.

Lgals7 (Galectin-7) is often associated with epithelial cells, particularly in skin or stratified epithelia. But I need to cross-reference. However, in the provided literature, there's no direct mention of Lgals7. Similarly, Kctd14 and Bmyc: Bmyc might be a typo for c-Myc (MYC), but Bmyc is a specific variant? Not sure. Gstm2 is glutathione S-transferase mu 2, which is often in liver, but also in other tissues. Ldhb is lactate dehydrogenase B, which is involved in energy metabolism, so maybe in cells with high glycolytic activity.

But the strongest clues are AMHR2, WNT6, and GNG13 pointing to granulosa or PG cells. Then, Ifitm1 and Laptm4b from the third paper might relate to immune cells, but since the other markers are more strongly pointing elsewhere, maybe the primary cell type is granulosa cells. However, the presence of Ifitm1 might also suggest some immune component, but perhaps in the context of ovarian cells or other tissues.

Wait, in the second literature, PG cells (pre-granulosa) have Amhr2 and Wnt6. The first literature's GC-specific genes include AMHR2, GNG13, WNT6. So if a cell has AMHR2, WNT6, and GNG13, that's strong for granulosa cells or PG cells. Then, considering the other markers: Laptm4b is mentioned in the third paper in the context of BCR-ABL1+ cells (CML), but that's human. However, in mice, maybe similar? But without more context, maybe it's a different cell type. 

Alternatively, if AMHR2 and WNT6 are in PG cells (pre-granulosa), and GNG13 is also a GC marker, then maybe the top cell type is granulosa cells. Then, other markers could be from other cell types. For example, Ifitm1 is in immune cells (like in the third paper's context), but if the cell has both granulosa markers and some immune markers, maybe it's a mix. However, the question is to pick the top 3 cell types based on all markers provided.

Wait, but the user says "the higher the probability, the further left it is ranked". So need to see which cell types have the most markers matching.

Let's list the markers and their possible associations:

- AMHR2: Granulosa cells, PG cells
- WNT6: Granulosa cells, PG cells
- GNG13: Granulosa cells
- Ifitm1: Immune cells (as per third paper, but could be other cells)
- Laptm4b: Possibly immune or cancer cells (from third paper)
- Lgals7: Epithelial cells, maybe keratinocytes
- Gstm2: Liver, but also other detoxifying cells
- Ldhb: Metabolic active cells, maybe muscle or others
- Kctd14: Not sure, maybe neural or other
- Bmyc: Possibly a typo, maybe Myc-related, but unclear

The strongest markers here are AMHR2, WNT6, and GNG13 all pointing to granulosa or PG cells. So the first candidate is Granulosa cells or PG cells. The second literature refers to PG cells (pre-granulosa) as a subset, which might be part of the ovarian follicle. So perhaps granulosa cells are the top.

Then, considering Ifitm1 and Laptm4b. Ifitm1 is mentioned in the third paper in the context of BCR-ABL1+ cells (CML), which are hematopoietic. So maybe immune cells? But if this cell has both granulosa and immune markers, but the presence of AMHR2 and WNT6 is more specific to granulosa, then immune might be a secondary possibility. However, the other markers (Lgals7, Gstm2, etc.) don't strongly point to immune. Alternatively, maybe Ifitm1 is expressed in some other cell type. For instance, Ifitm1 is also found in germ cells or stem cells. But given the literature provided, the third paper links it to immune-related contexts.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a mix, but more likely granulosa cells as the top, then perhaps immune cells as second, but I need to check if any other markers support that. Laptm4b in the third paper is part of genes related to cell adhesion, etc., but not sure. 

Alternatively, looking at Lgals7 (Galectin-7) is typically in stratified epithelial cells, like skin. So maybe keratinocytes. But do any of the other markers support that? Gstm2 is in detox, which could be liver or kidney. Ldhb is in many cells. So maybe the third cell type is epithelial, like keratinocytes.

But the strongest are the first three markers (AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13) pointing to granulosa or PG cells. Then, Ifitm1 and Laptm4b might be part of another cell type. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a granulosa cell with some additional markers, but the presence of Ifitm1 and Laptm4b could indicate a different cell type. However, since the user asks for top 3 cell types based on all markers, perhaps another cell type is immune cells, but need to see if any other markers support that.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a mix, but the top three would be:

1. Granulosa cells (due to AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13)
2. Immune cells (due to Ifitm1, Laptm4b)
3. Epithelial cells (due to Lgals7, Gstm2, Ldhb)

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in the second literature, PG cells (clusters 3 and 7) express Amhr2 and Wnt6. Stromal cells have Col1a1, etc. So PG cells are a type of granulosa cell precursor. So maybe the top cell type is PG cells (pre-granulosa), then granulosa cells. But perhaps they are considered the same in some contexts.

Alternatively, the first literature mentions GC-specific genes (granulosa cells) including AMHR2, GNG13, WNT6, so if all three are present, that's strong for granulosa cells. Then, Ifitm1 and Laptm4b might be in another cell type. But since the user wants the top 3 cell types for the same cell, maybe the cell is primarily granulosa, but other markers could suggest some other lineage.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell is an oocyte? But in the second literature, oocytes express Dppa3, Sycp3, etc., which are not in the given markers. So probably not.

Another thought: The presence of Laptm4b and Ifitm1 could indicate hematopoietic stem cells or myeloid cells. For example, IFITM1 is involved in immune response, and LAPTM4B is associated with lysosomes and might be in immune cells. But without more markers, it's hard. 

So, compiling all this:

Top 1: Granulosa cells (AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13)
Top 2: PG cells (pre-granulosa) from the second literature, which also have AMHR2 and WNT6, but maybe considered a subset of granulosa cells. But since they are listed as separate in the second paper, maybe PG cells is a separate entry. But I need to check if PG cells and granulosa cells are the same. Typically, pre-granulosa cells (PG) differentiate into granulosa cells, so they might be considered distinct. However, in terms of cell type classification, they might be grouped under granulosa cells. Alternatively, if the literature lists PG cells as a separate type, then PG cells could be the top.

Wait, the second literature says "PG cells (clusters 3 and 7) with Fst, Kitl, Amhr2 and Wnt6 expression". So PG cells are a separate cell type from oocytes, stromal cells, etc. So if the markers include AMHR2 and WNT6, then PG cells would be a primary candidate.

But the first literature says that GC-specific genes include AMHR2, GNG13, WNT6. So granulosa cells have those. So there's a conflict here: are AMHR2 and WNT6 markers for PG cells or granulosa cells? It might depend on the differentiation stage. PG cells might be precursors to granulosa cells, so they share some markers. But in the second paper, PG cells are a separate cluster. So if the markers here are AMHR2, WNT6, and GNG13 (which is in GCs), then maybe the cell is a granulosa cell. However, GNG13 is listed in the first paper as a GC-specific gene, so that would point to granulosa cells rather than PG cells. Therefore, the top would be granulosa cells.

Then, PG cells would be a separate type if the markers include AMHR2 and WNT6 but not GNG13. But since GNG13 is present here, that leans more towards granulosa cells.

So first: Granulosa cells.

Next, Ifitm1 and Laptm4b. The third literature links them to BCR-ABL1+ cells (CML), which are a type of leukemia, so hematopoietic/immune origin. So the second cell type could be immune cells, perhaps myeloid or lymphocytes. However, other markers like Lgals7 (epithelial) and Gstm2 (liver) don't support that. Alternatively, Ifitm1 is also expressed in germ cells or other stem cells, but that's not clear here.

Alternatively, Ifitm1 is found in various cells, including embryonic stem cells, but without more context, it's hard. Laptm4b might be in lysosomes, so perhaps in cells with high lysosomal activity, like macrophages or other immune cells. But again, the other markers don't strongly support immune. 

Third, Lgals7 (Galectin-7) is a marker for keratinocytes, which are epithelial cells in the skin. So maybe epithelial cells as the third type. Gstm2 is in liver, but also other epithelial tissues. Ldhb is in many cells, including muscle and epithelial.

So possible ranking:

1. Granulosa cells (AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13)
2. Immune cells (Ifitm1, Laptm4b)
3. Epithelial cells (Lgals7, Gstm2)

But I need to check if any other combinations make sense. For example, Bmyc (if it's a typo for c-Myc) is a proto-oncogene expressed in many proliferating cells. Not specific. Kctd14 might be in neural cells, but not sure.

Alternatively, some markers might be specific to other cell types. For instance, Amhr2 is also involved in Müllerian duct development, so maybe cells related to reproductive tracts. But granulosa cells are part of the ovary, which fits.

Another angle: The presence of Ldhb, which is involved in lactate metabolism. Cells with high glycolytic activity, like cancer cells, muscle cells, or certain stem cells. But without more context, hard to say.

Putting it all together, the strongest markers point to granulosa cells as the top. The next would be immune cells based on Ifitm1 and Laptm4b. Third, epithelial cells (like keratinocytes) due to Lgals7. But I'm not entirely confident about the second and third positions. Alternatively, maybe stromal cells or another type.

Wait, in the second literature, stromal cells express Col1a1, Dcn, etc., which aren't in the given markers. So stromal cells are not indicated here. Immune cells have Lyz2, Ptprc, etc., which are not in the given list. So maybe immune cells are less likely. If Ifitm1 and Laptm4b are the only immune-related markers, but others are not, maybe the second cell type is something else.

Alternatively, considering that the third paper's context is about BCR-ABL1+ cells (leukemia), but the markers there include IFITM1 and LAPTM4B. So if this cell is a leukemia cell (cancerous hematopoietic), then maybe myeloid cells. But this is speculative. However, the user said not to infer solely based on the provided literature, so maybe the main clues are from the first and second papers.

In that case, the top three would be:

1. Granulosa cells (AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13)
2. PG cells (AMHR2, WNT6, but lacking GNG13? But the given markers do have GNG13, so maybe PG cells are less likely)
Wait, in the second literature, PG cells have Amhr2 and Wnt6, but not GNG13 mentioned. The first literature says GNG13 is a GC gene, which is granulosa. So if all three are present, it's more likely granulosa cells. So PG cells might not have GNG13. Therefore, granulosa cells are the top.

Then, Ifitm1 and Laptm4b: maybe a hematopoietic stem cell or progenitor, but not sure. Alternatively, the third paper's context is about CML, so maybe myeloid lineage. However, without more markers, it's hard. So maybe the second cell type is immune cells (myeloid), third is epithelial.

Alternatively, another approach: check each gene's typical cell types.

- AMHR2: granulosa cells, Müllerian duct cells
- WNT6: granulosa cells, various developmental contexts
- GNG13: granulosa cells, also found in some neural tissues
- Ifitm1: immune cells, germ cells, embryonic stem cells
- Laptm4b: lysosomal, expressed in various tissues including immune and cancer cells
- Lgals7: epithelial cells, especially keratinocytes
- Gstm2: liver, kidney, detox organs
- Ldhb: widespread, high in muscle, liver, etc.
- Kctd14: possibly neural, but not well-known
- Bmyc: if it's B-myc, maybe B cells? But I think Bmyc is a different gene; possibly a typo.

Given this, the primary cell type is granulosa cells. The presence of Ifitm1 and Laptm4b might indicate a secondary cell type like immune cells. Lgals7 and Gstm2 could point to epithelial or liver cells. However, liver cells (hepatocytes) typically express Gstm2, but other markers don't support that. So third could be epithelial cells.

Alternatively, the presence of Ldhb and Gstm2 might suggest a metabolic cell type, like hepatocytes or muscle, but without more specific markers, it's hard. 

Another angle: Ifitm1 is also expressed in primordial germ cells. But AMHR2 is more specific to granulosa cells. So maybe the second cell type is germ cells? But not sure.

Alternatively, considering the third paper's mention of LAPTM4B in cell adhesion and signaling, maybe cancer cells, but that's a stretch.

In conclusion, the most supported cell type is granulosa cells. For the other two, it's less clear, but based on the markers:

- Ifitm1 and Laptm4b: immune cells (possibly myeloid or lymphocytes)
- Lgals7: epithelial cells (keratinocytes)

But how confident am I about the order? The user wants the top 3, ordered by probability. Granulosa cells are definitely first. Then, immune cells might be second if Ifitm1 and Laptm4b are strong enough, but in the context of the other markers (like AMHR2 and WNT6 being very specific), maybe the cell is primarily granulosa with some other markers, but the other cell types are less likely. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a mix, but the task is to list cell types, not a mixed population.

Alternatively, another cell type that expresses multiple markers: for example, ovarian stromal cells? But the second literature says stromal cells have Col1a1, Dcn, etc., which aren't in the given markers.

Alternatively, the cell could be a theca cell, but I don't see markers for that.

Alternatively, maybe Sertoli cells in testes, but AMHR2 is also in granulosa cells.

Given all this, I think the top 3 cell types are:

1. Granulosa cells
2. Immune cells (e.g., myeloid cells)
3. Epithelial cells (e.g., keratinocytes)

But I'm not entirely certain about the second and third. Another possibility is that the second cell type is PG cells, but since GNG13 is a granulosa marker, maybe granulosa is more likely. Maybe the third is stromal cells, but there's no supporting markers. Alternatively, the third could be hepatocytes due to Gstm2, but again, not enough markers.

Alternatively, considering the presence of Bmyc (if it's a Myc gene), which is involved in proliferation, maybe stem cells or cancer cells, but that's too vague.

Given the uncertainty, but based on the strongest markers (AMHR2, WNT6, GNG13), the top is granulosa cells. The next two would have to be based on the remaining markers: Ifitm1 and Laptm4b (immune), Lgals7 (epithelial). So the final answer would be:

Granulosa cells, Immune cells, Epithelial cells

But let me check if any of the other markers support other cell types. For example, Ldhb is highly expressed in cells with active glycolysis, like muscle cells or cancer cells. But without more markers, can't say. Gstm2 is in liver, but also in other cells. Kctd14 is not informative enough.

So sticking with the initial thought, the top three are:

1. Granulosa cells
2. Immune cells
3. Epithelial cells
</think>

Granulosa cells, Immune cells, Epithelial cells
