===================deepseek-r1 response =====================
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to identify the top 3 most likely mouse cell types based on the given marker genes: Mylk, Acta2, Myl9, Mdk, Cdkn1c, Ptn, Dlk1, Itm2a, Meg3, Mfap2. They also provided some literature excerpts for reference, but mentioned not to rely solely on them.

First, I need to recall what each of these markers typically indicate. Let me start by listing each marker and think about their associated cell types.

- Acta2: This is a well-known marker for smooth muscle cells (SMC) and myofibroblasts. It encodes alpha-smooth muscle actin.
- Mylk and Myl9: These are myosin light chain kinases and myosin light chain 9, respectively. Both are involved in smooth muscle contraction, so again pointing towards SMCs or pericytes.
- Mdk and Ptn: Midkine and pleiotrophin are growth factors often associated with various cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) or certain fibroblasts. The first PMC (PMC9248914) mentions PTN and MDK as markers for vascular SMCs or adventitial fibroblasts.
- Cdkn1c: Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C. The second PMC (PMC4963112) notes that Cdkn1c is downregulated in certain contexts related to cell cycle control. Maybe in cells with lower proliferation?
- Dlk1 and Itm2a: These genes are mentioned in the second PMC as being downregulated in bone-related contexts. Dlk1 is a transmembrane protein involved in adipogenesis and might be found in stromal cells or preadipocytes. Itm2a is associated with chondrocytes or certain fibroblasts.
- Meg3: This is a long non-coding RNA, often implicated in various regulatory functions. It might be expressed in fibroblasts or certain progenitor cells.
- Mfap2: Microfibrillar-associated protein 2. The third PMC (PMC9156976) lists Mfap2 in EN1-negative myofibroblasts. Also, found in extracellular matrix components, so maybe fibroblasts or myofibroblasts.

Looking at the literature snippets:

1. PMC9248914: PTN and MDK are higher in SCT stromal cells, which are vascular SMCs or adventitial fibroblasts. Also, MYL9, ACTA2 are myofibroblast markers. But in this study, they were comparable between groups, while RGS5, NOTCH3, PTN, MDK, etc., were higher in SCT (vascular SMC/adventitial fibroblasts).

2. PMC4963112: Ptn, Dlk1, Itm2a are downregulated in some bone-related context. Cdkn1c is involved in cell cycle control (down here). So maybe these markers are present in cell types that are being regulated in such processes.

3. PMC9156976: Lists pericytes with markers Acta2, Myl9, Mylk, Rgs5, Tagln. EN1-negative myofibroblasts include Mfap2. So pericytes have Acta2, Myl9, Mylk. Also, vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) share some of these markers.

Putting this together:

- Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 are strong indicators for pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells. The third PMC explicitly lists pericytes with these markers. So pericytes are a top candidate.
- Mfap2 is in EN1-negative myofibroblasts according to PMC9156976. So myofibroblasts could be another cell type. However, the first PMC says that myofibroblast markers like Acta2, MYL9 are comparable, but vSMC markers like PTN, MDK are higher. So maybe vascular SMCs?
- MDK and PTN are in the first PMC linked to vascular SMCs or adventitial fibroblasts. Dlk1 and Itm2a from the second PMC could be in fibroblasts, perhaps. Cdkn1c's presence might indicate a role in cell cycle regulation, maybe in quiescent cells like pericytes or certain fibroblasts.

So possible cell types:

1. Pericytes (due to Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, possibly Rgs5 but not listed here)
2. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs) (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, MDK, PTN)
3. Myofibroblasts (Acta2, Myl9, Mfap2)

But need to check all markers. Let's see:

Pericytes (from PMC9156976): markers include Acta2, Myl9, Mylk. So that's three markers. MDK and PTN are in the first study as vSMC markers, so maybe if present, that's more vSMC. But if the cell has both pericytes and vSMC markers, which is higher?

Alternatively, adventitial fibroblasts (from first PMC) have markers like PTN, MDK. So if the cell has PTN, MDK, along with Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, it might be a mix. But perhaps the strongest signals are from the pericytes (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9) and then MDK and PTN could point towards vSMC or adventitial fibroblasts.

Another point: Cdkn1c is mentioned in the second PMC as being downregulated in cell cycle control. If this cell has Cdkn1c, maybe it's a cell type where Cdkn1c is typically expressed, like certain progenitor cells or other fibroblasts.

Dlk1 and Itm2a: In the second study, they are downregulated in the context of bone metabolism. Dlk1 is involved in adipogenesis and stromal cells. Itm2a is associated with chondrocytes or fibroblasts.

Meg3 is a lncRNA, maybe found in fibroblasts or stem cells.

Mfap2 is in myofibroblasts (EN1-negative) as per third study.

Putting all together, the markers point towards:

- Pericytes (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9)
- Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs) (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, MDK, PTN)
- Myofibroblasts (Acta2, Myl9, Mfap2, possibly others)

But also, adventitial fibroblasts (from first study) have PTN, MDK. So if the cell has PTN and MDK along with Acta2, maybe it's a vSMC or adventitial fibroblast. But the presence of Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 is stronger for pericytes or vSMCs.

So ranking:

1. Pericytes (highest due to Acta2, Mylk, Myl9)
2. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs) (also have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 plus MDK, PTN)
3. Myofibroblasts (Acta2, Myl9, Mfap2)

Alternatively, if adventitial fibroblasts are considered, but the markers MDK, PTN are there. However, adventitial fibroblasts may not have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 as strongly. Since the first study says that vSMC markers are RGS5, NOTCH3, PTN, MDK, etc., but the pericytes in the third study have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9. So maybe the cell is a pericyte which also expresses some vSMC markers. Or it's a vSMC. But according to the first study, the SCT stromal cells (which are vSMC/adventitial fibroblasts) have higher PTN, MDK, etc., while myofibroblast markers (Acta2, MYL9) are comparable. So maybe in this case, the presence of Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 along with MDK, PTN would point more towards vSMCs.

Wait, but the third study's pericytes have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, and Rgs5. The user's markers don't include Rgs5. So maybe it's pericytes regardless. Or maybe vSMCs. How do I differentiate pericytes vs vSMCs here?

Pericytes and vSMCs share many markers, but pericytes are often associated with capillaries, while vSMCs are in larger vessels. However, marker-wise, they can overlap. The third study lists pericytes with Acta2, Mylk, Myl9. The first study's vSMC markers include PTN, MDK. So if the cell in question has PTN and MDK, which are in the user's list, then perhaps it's a vSMC. But the pericytes in the third study don't mention PTN or MDK. So combining markers from both, vSMC might have PTN and MDK along with Acta2, Mylk, Myl9.

Thus, the cell could be vSMC as the top, then pericytes (if PTN and MDK are not their main markers), but the third study's pericytes don't have those. Alternatively, maybe adventitial fibroblasts, but the presence of Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 suggests more contractile cells like SMC or pericytes.

Wait, the first study says that markers of vSMCs or adventitial fibroblasts (RGS5, NOTCH3, PTN, PHLDA1, CCND2, MDK, MYH11, etc.) are more abundant in SCT stromal cells. So PTN and MDK are part of that group. So if the cell has PTN and MDK along with Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, it might be vSMC. However, the pericytes in the third study (PMC9156976) have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, but not PTN or MDK. So the presence of PTN and MDK might push it towards vSMC.

But the user's list includes both pericytes markers (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9) and vSMC/adventitial fibroblast markers (PTN, MDK). So which is more prominent?

Looking at the number of markers for each:

- Pericytes: Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 (3 markers)
- vSMC: PTN, MDK (2 markers), but also share Acta2, Mylk, Myl9
- Myofibroblasts: Acta2, Mfap2 (2 markers)
- Adventitial fibroblasts: PTN, MDK (2 markers)

Wait, but if vSMC and pericytes both share Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, but the presence of PTN and MDK (from the first study) would suggest vSMC over pericytes. So maybe vSMC is the top, then pericytes.

But the third study's pericytes do not have PTN or MDK, so if the cell has those, it's more likely vSMC. But the user's markers include Mfap2, which is in myofibroblasts (EN1-negative) according to the third study. So Mfap2 is a myofibroblast marker. So Mfap2, along with Acta2, might indicate myofibroblasts.

But then, the user's markers also have Dlk1, Itm2a, Cdkn1c, Meg3. How do these fit in?

Looking at the second study (PMC4963112), Ptn, Dlk1, Itm2a are downregulated in certain conditions related to bone. But Dlk1 is also known in preadipocytes and stromal cells. Itm2a is in chondrocytes. Cdkn1c is involved in cell cycle exit, maybe in quiescent cells.

Meg3 is a lncRNA, possibly in fibroblasts or other mesenchymal cells.

Putting all together, the cell might be a mix of features. But based on the strongest markers:

- Acta2, Mylk, Myl9: strong for pericytes or vSMC
- PTN, MDK: vSMC or adventitial fibroblasts
- Mfap2: myofibroblasts

But considering all markers, perhaps the cell is a myofibroblast with some smooth muscle features (since myofibroblasts can express Acta2), plus Mfap2. But also, the presence of PTN and MDK might point towards a stromal cell type like adventitial fibroblasts. However, adventitial fibroblasts might not express Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 as strongly.

Alternatively, vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) expressing Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, along with PTN and MDK. Then Mfap2 might be another marker, but according to the third study, Mfap2 is in myofibroblasts. However, maybe some overlap exists.

This is a bit conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps look for the most overlapping cell type with the majority of markers.

Markers present:

- Acta2: pericytes, vSMC, myofibroblasts
- Mylk: pericytes, vSMC
- Myl9: pericytes, vSMC
- MDK: vSMC, adventitial fibroblasts
- PTN: vSMC, adventitial fibroblasts
- Mfap2: myofibroblasts
- Cdkn1c: possibly in cells with cell cycle regulation (maybe quiescent cells like pericytes or certain fibroblasts)
- Dlk1: stromal cells, preadipocytes
- Itm2a: chondrocytes, fibroblasts
- Meg3: fibroblasts, other mesenchymal cells

So combining these, the cell has markers of contractile cells (pericytes/vSMC), some stromal/fibroblast markers (Mfap2, Dlk1, Itm2a), and others.

This might suggest a myofibroblast with smooth muscle-like properties (myofibroblasts can express Acta2), but also expressing some stromal markers. Alternatively, a pericyte with some additional markers.

But based on the literature given:

Third study: pericytes have Acta2, Mylk, Myl9. Myofibroblasts (EN1-negative) have Mfap2. So if the cell has Mfap2 plus Acta2, maybe it's a myofibroblast. However, the first study mentioned that myofibroblast markers (including Acta2, MYL9) were comparable between groups, but vSMC markers (PTN, MDK) were higher in SCT cells. So if the cell has high PTN and MDK, maybe it's vSMC. But also has Mfap2 which is in myofibroblasts. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell is a pericyte that also expresses Mfap2, but in the third study, Mfap2 is in myofibroblasts, not pericytes. So the presence of Mfap2 might push towards myofibroblast.

But then, the myofibroblast would have Acta2, Myl9 (from first study), Mfap2. So combining these, maybe myofibroblast is a candidate.

So possible ranking:

1. Pericytes (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9)
2. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs) (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, PTN, MDK)
3. Myofibroblasts (Acta2, Myl9, Mfap2)

But another angle: since Mfap2 is specific to myofibroblasts in the third study, and the presence of PTN and MDK for vSMC, which is higher? Maybe vSMC is higher than pericytes because of PTN and MDK. But the third study's pericytes don't have those markers. So perhaps:

1. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs)
2. Pericytes
3. Myofibroblasts

But I need to check how many markers each cell type has. The user's list includes 10 markers. Let's count how many match each cell type:

For vSMCs (based on first study: PTN, MDK, along with Acta2, Mylk, Myl9). That's 5 markers (Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, PTN, MDK). Also, maybe others like NOTCH3, but those aren't in the user's list.

Pericytes (from third study: Acta2, Mylk, Myl9, Rgs5, Tagln). User's markers include Acta2, Mylk, Myl9 (3 markers).

Myofibroblasts (from third study: Mfap2, others not in user's list). User's markers include Mfap2, Acta2, Myl9 (3 markers).

Other markers: Cdkn1c, Dlk1, Itm2a, Meg3. These might not strongly indicate any of the top three, but perhaps Cdkn1c is in cells with cell cycle regulation, maybe quiescent pericytes or fibroblasts. Dlk1 and Itm2a could be in fibroblasts or stromal cells. Meg3 in fibroblasts.

So vSMC has the most markers (5), pericytes and myofibroblasts each have 3. So based on count, vSMC would be first.

But the third study's pericytes don't have PTN or MDK, so if the cell has those, it's more likely vSMC.

Therefore, the ranking would be:

1. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (vSMCs)
2. Pericytes
3. Myofibroblasts

Alternatively, if the combination of markers is more indicative of myofibroblasts (given Mfap2), but since vSMC has more markers, it's higher.

So final answer: Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells, Pericytes, Myofibroblasts
</think>

Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells, Pericytes, Myofibroblasts
