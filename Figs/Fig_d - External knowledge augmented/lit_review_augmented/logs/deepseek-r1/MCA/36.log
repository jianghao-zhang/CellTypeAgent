pmcid: PMC7768892
section: None
content: demonstrated that the mouse Rhox5, Rhox6, and Rhox9 genes are induced by the DNA methylation inhibitor 5AzaC in mouse cell lines, implying that several Rhox genes are repressed in cell lines by DNA methylation.

pmcid: PMC7768892
section: None
content: In contrast, the requirement for DNMT1 depended on the Rhox gene promoter tested; Rhox6 and Rhox9 promoter methylation was dramatically inhibited in Dnmt1-mutant ES cells, whereas Rhox2 and Rhox5 promoter methylation was little affected.

pmcid: PMC7768892
section: None

Okay, let's try to figure out the top 3 cell types based on the given markers. The markers listed are Sct, Rhox9, Rhox6, Ldoc1, Sin3b, Fthl17a, Cdkn1c, Gm9112, Rhox5, and 3830417A13Rik.

First, I remember that Rhox genes are a cluster on the X chromosome, often associated with reproductive tissues. The literature mentions Rhox5, Rhox6, and Rhox9 being regulated by DNA methylation in ES cells. ES cells are embryonic stem cells, but Rhox genes are also expressed in germ cells. Wait, but the literature here is talking about repression in cell lines like ES cells. So if they're hypermethylated and repressed in ES cells, maybe they're active in cells where methylation is lower, like germ cells?

Sct is secretin. I think secretin is expressed in certain endocrine cells, maybe in the small intestine or pancreas. Wait, but in mice, could Sct be in other cell types? Alternatively, Sct might be a marker for Sertoli cells. Wait, Sertoli cells are in the testes. Rhox genes are also expressed in the testes. So combining Sct with Rhox genes, maybe this points towards testicular cells. For example, Sertoli cells, germ cells, or Leydig cells.

Ldoc1 is a gene I'm less familiar with. A quick search in my mind: LDOC1 is sometimes associated with apoptosis and might be expressed in lymphocytes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in certain epithelial cells. But given the other markers, perhaps it's more relevant to reproductive cells.

Cdkn1c is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, involved in cell cycle regulation. It's imprinted and expressed in various tissues, including placental and embryonic tissues. But again, in combination with Rhox genes, maybe placental cells? Or embryonic stem cells?

Fthl17a is a ferritin-like protein, possibly involved in iron storage. Not sure about its cell specificity. Gm9112 and 3830417A13Rik are likely RIKEN identifiers, which I don't know offhand. Sin3b is part of a transcriptional repressor complex, involved in various cell processes.

Putting this together: the strongest clues are the Rhox genes (Rhox5,6,9) which are typically expressed in the reproductive tract, especially testes. Sct (secretin) might be Sertoli cells. So possible cell types could be Sertoli cells, germ cells, or maybe Leydig cells. Alternatively, if the Rhox genes are repressed in ES cells but active in their differentiated progeny, maybe some placental cells? But given that the literature mentions ES cells and their methylation status, but the question is about the cell types expressing these markers. So if in ES cells these genes are repressed, then the actual cell types where they are active would be cells where methylation is low, like germ cells.

Another angle: Cdkn1c is also known to be expressed in placental cells. But combining with Rhox, maybe placental trophoblast cells? But Rhox genes are more testes-specific.

Wait, Rhox5 (also called Pem) is expressed in Sertoli cells and placental trophoblast cells. Rhox6 and Rhox9 are also part of the reproductive homeobox genes. So possible cell types: Sertoli cells, germ cells (spermatogonia, sperm cells), and maybe trophoblast cells.

But Sct is secretin. Secretin is mainly produced in the small intestine, but there's also a possibility of expression in testes. Alternatively, maybe the Sct here is a different gene? Wait, Sct is the gene symbol for secretin. If it's expressed in Sertoli cells, that's a strong indicator. So Sertoli cells would be a top candidate.

Other markers: Ldoc1 might be in lymphocytes, but if the other markers point to reproductive, maybe not. Sin3b is a general transcriptional regulator, so less specific.

Putting it all together, the top three cell types are likely:

1. Sertoli cells (due to Sct and Rhox genes)
2. Germ cells (spermatogonia/sperm cells, due to Rhox cluster)
3. Trophoblast cells (Rhox5 and Cdkn1c)

Alternatively, maybe Leydig cells instead of trophoblast, but Cdkn1c in trophoblast. Or maybe placental cells. But given the markers, I think the strongest candidates are testicular cells. So the top three would be Sertoli cells, male germ cells, and perhaps trophoblast cells. But I need to verify if trophoblast cells express these Rhox genes. Alternatively, maybe another testicular cell type like Leydig cells. But Rhox5 is in Sertoli cells. Let me check: Rhox5 is indeed expressed in Sertoli cells. Rhox6 and Rhox9 are also in male germ cells. So maybe:

1. Sertoli cells
2. Spermatogonial stem cells
3. Leydig cells

Alternatively, if Cdkn1c is more placental, then trophoblast. But I'm not sure. Another approach: look up marker genes for these cell types. Sertoli cells: markers like Gata4, Sox9, but the given markers here are Sct (secretin), which I need to confirm if it's a Sertoli marker. Alternatively, maybe Sct is not the best marker, but in combination with Rhox genes. Maybe the answer is:

Sertoli cells, germ cells, and trophoblast cells. Or maybe embryonic stem cells, but the literature says Rhox genes are repressed there. So active in cells where they are not repressed, hence reproductive cells. So the top three are likely Sertoli cells, spermatogenic cells, and maybe another testicular cell type. Alternatively, placental trophoblasts. But I need to make a decision. Another point: the marker Fthl17a is expressed in oocytes and early embryos? Not sure. If that's the case, maybe oocytes, but the Rhox genes are more male-specific. So perhaps the answer is Sertoli cells, male germ cells, and then trophoblast cells. But I need to check if trophoblasts express Cdkn1c. Cdkn1c is involved in placental development. So combining Cdkn1c with Rhox5, maybe trophoblast cells. So the top three could be:

1. Sertoli cells
2. Male germ cells (spermatogonia/sperm)
3. Trophoblast cells

Alternatively, if Ldoc1 is a marker for another cell type. But with the information at hand, I think the answer is Sertoli cells, germ cells, and trophoblasts. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that Rhox genes are also expressed in early embryonic cells, but the literature says they are repressed in ES cells. So maybe they're active in differentiated cells, like extraembryonic tissues. Alternatively, maybe the cells are from the male reproductive system. Therefore, the top three cell types are likely Sertoli cells, germ cells, and Leydig cells. But I need to be precise. Since the literature mentions ES cells but the markers are active where they're not repressed, the cell types would be those where Rhox5,6,9 are active. These are known to be expressed in the male reproductive tract. Sertoli cells (Rhox5), germ cells (Rhox6,9), and maybe another cell type like epididymal cells. Alternatively, trophoblast. Considering Cdkn1c, which is in placenta. Maybe the third is trophoblast. So final answer: Sertoli cells, male germ cells, trophoblast cells. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the third is embryonic stem cells, but the literature says Rhox genes are repressed there. So probably not. So the top three would be Sertoli cells, germ cells, and trophoblasts. But I need to check if Sct is a marker for Sertoli cells. Upon a quick recall, Sct (secretin) is mainly produced in the intestines, but there's some evidence of expression in testes. However, Sertoli cell markers are typically like AMH, GATA4, SOX9. Maybe Sct isn't a primary Sertoli marker. Alternatively, maybe the presence of Rhox genes is more indicative. If Rhox5 is in Sertoli cells, then yes. So maybe Sertoli cells are first. Then germ cells. Then perhaps another cell type. Alternatively, placental cells. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe these markers indicate embryonic germ cells or primordial germ cells. But I'm not certain. Given the uncertainty, I think the most probable answer based on Rhox genes and Sct would be Sertoli cells, male germ cells, and trophoblast cells. So the top three cell types: Sertoli cells, spermatogonial cells, trophoblast cells. Or maybe replace trophoblast with Leydig cells. Alternatively, placental trophoblast. I'll go with Sertoli cells, male germ cells, and trophoblast cells as the top three.
