Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Calb1, Rprm, Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, Cldn6, Mdk, Hoxb7, Cldn7, Ldhb, Ptma. They also provided some literature, but said not to rely solely on that. So, I need to focus on the markers themselves.

First, I'll start by recalling what each of these markers typically indicates. Let's list them out and think about each one:

1. **Calb1 (Calbindin 1)**: Often found in neurons, especially in the cerebellum, but also in certain epithelial cells like renal distal tubules and pancreatic beta cells.
2. **Rprm (Reprimo)**: Involved in cell cycle regulation, possibly in germ cells or some cancer cells. The literature mentions it in mammary tumor cells, so maybe mammary or reproductive tissues.
3. **Wfdc2 (WAP Four-Disulfide Core Domain 2)**: Also known as HE4, commonly associated with reproductive tissues, like ovarian surface epithelial cells or oviduct cells.
4. **Wfdc15b**: Part of the same family as Wfdc2. Might be found in similar locations, maybe epididymal cells or other secretory cells.
5. **Cldn6 (Claudin 6)**: Tight junction protein; found in embryonic tissues, placenta, and some cancers. Also in certain epithelial layers.
6. **Mdk (Midkine)**: Growth factor involved in development, found in neuroepithelial cells, certain tumors, and during kidney development.
7. **Hoxb7 (Homeobox B7)**: Plays a role in developmental patterning; associated with tissues like the mammary gland, kidney (ureteric bud), and some epithelial structures.
8. **Cldn7 (Claudin 7)**: Another claudin family member, often in epithelial cells, such as in the kidney, intestine, and mammary gland.
9. **Ldhb (Lactate Dehydrogenase B)**: Involved in energy metabolism; expressed in tissues with high metabolic activity like muscle, liver, and certain tumors.
10. **Ptma (Prothymosin alpha)**: Ubiquitously expressed, but high in proliferating cells, including stem cells, lymphocytes, and cancer cells.

Now, grouping these markers to find common cell types. Let's see:

- **Reproductive or glandular cells**: Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are prominent in reproductive tissues. Rprm is mentioned in mammary tumors. Hoxb7 is linked to mammary gland development. Claudins 6 and 7 are in epithelial layers, possibly mammary or kidney. MDK and Hoxb7 might point towards mammary or kidney epithelial cells.

- **Kidney cells**: Calb1 is in renal distal tubules. Hoxb7 is involved in kidney development (ureteric bud). Claudins 6 and 7 are present in kidney epithelia. MDK is also involved in kidney development.

- **Neuronal cells**: Calb1 is a strong neuronal marker, but other markers like MDK can be found in neuroepithelial cells. However, other markers like Wfdc2 and Rprm don't align strongly here.

- **Epithelial cells in general**: Claudins are tight junction proteins. Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b could be in secretory epithelia. Hoxb7 in mammary or ureteric epithelia.

Looking for overlaps:

- **Kidney tubule epithelial cells**: Calb1 (distal tubules), Hoxb7 (ureteric bud), Cldn6/7 (epithelial tight junctions), MDK (kidney development). Ldhb could be present due to metabolic activity.

- **Mammary gland epithelial cells**: Rprm (mammary tumor), Hoxb7 (mammary development), Wfdc2 (possible secretory function), Claudins 6/7 (epithelial tight junctions), MDK (growth factor here).

- **Oviduct or ovarian surface epithelial cells**: Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are strong here. However, other markers like Hoxb7 or Claudins might not be as specific unless in reproductive tract epithelia.

Another angle: Check if any of these markers are specific to certain cell types in databases. For example:

- **Wfdc2** is a known marker for oviductal epithelial cells in mice. **Wfdc15b** is also expressed in the epididymis. **Hoxb7** is found in the ureteric bud of the kidney and mammary glands. **Cldn6** is in embryonic tissues and some epithelia. **Rprm** in mammary tumors. **Calb1** in kidney distal tubules and neurons.

Putting this together, possible cell types:

1. **Kidney epithelial cells** (distal tubule/ureteric bud): Calb1, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, MDK, Ldhb.
2. **Mammary gland epithelial cells**: Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, Wfdc2 (maybe), MDK.
3. **Oviductal epithelial cells**: Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, maybe others like Claudins.

Alternatively, the presence of Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b might point more towards reproductive tract cells. But in mice, Wfdc2 is also expressed in the epididymis. However, combining with other markers like Hoxb7 and Claudins, perhaps it's more likely to be kidney or mammary.

But wait, in the literature provided, Rprm is mentioned in mammary tumor cells, and MDK and Wfdc2 are linked to cancer proliferation. However, the user said not to rely solely on literature. So maybe the cell types are cancer-related, but in normal mouse cells, what would these markers indicate?

Alternatively, maybe **renal tubular cells**, **mammary epithelial cells**, and **oviductal epithelial cells**.

Another thought: **Sertoli cells** in testes express some WFDC proteins, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, **coiled tubule cells** in the epididymis.

Wait, but Calb1 in kidney, Hoxb7 in ureteric bud (which is part of kidney development), Cldn6/7 in epithelia. MDK in kidney development. So kidney epithelial cells might be top.

Mammary epithelial cells: Rprm (from the literature in mammary tumors), Hoxb7 (mammary gland), Claudins, MDK (proliferation), Wfdc2 (maybe not typical here, but possible if it's a secretory cell).

Alternatively, if Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are more specific to the reproductive tract, then oviduct or epididymal cells. But how do the other markers fit? Hoxb7 might be in oviduct? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe **lung epithelial cells**, since the literature mentions MDK and WFDC2 in lung cancer. But the question is about normal mouse cells. So maybe Clara cells or type II pneumocytes? However, I don't recall those markers being specific for lung.

Alternatively, if considering cancer cells, but the question is about cell types in general, not necessarily cancerous.

Hmm. Let's try to rank:

1. **Kidney tubular epithelial cells** (Calb1, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, MDK, Ldhb)
2. **Mammary gland epithelial cells** (Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, MDK)
3. **Oviductal epithelial cells** (Wfdc2, Wfdc15b)

Alternatively, maybe **epididymal epithelial cells** for Wfdc15b and Wfdc2, but I'm less certain.

Another angle: Ptma is a proliferation marker, so maybe stem or progenitor cells. But other markers don't align as much.

Alternatively, **embryonic stem cells** with Cldn6, MDK, Hoxb7, but that's a stretch.

Wait, let's check each marker's specificity again:

- **Calb1**: Kidney distal tubules, neurons, pancreatic beta cells.
- **Rprm**: Testis, ovary, mammary gland (from literature: mammary tumor cells).
- **Wfdc2**: Oviduct, epididymis, some cancers.
- **Wfdc15b**: Epididymis.
- **Cldn6**: Embryonic tissues, placenta, some epithelia.
- **Mdk**: Kidney development, neuroepithelium, various cancers.
- **Hoxb7**: Mammary gland, ureteric bud (kidney).
- **Cldn7**: Kidney, mammary gland, intestine.
- **Ldhb**: High metabolic tissues (muscle, liver, some epithelia).
- **Ptma**: Proliferating cells.

So, combining:

- Kidney: Calb1, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, Mdk, Ldhb
- Mammary gland: Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, Mdk
- Epididymis/Oviduct: Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, maybe Cldn7

But in mouse, the epididymis has segments, and Wfdc15b is specific to certain regions. However, how do other markers fit here? Maybe the presence of Hoxb7 and Claudins in epididymis? Not sure.

Alternatively, if the cell type is from the reproductive tract, but also has Claudins and Hoxb7, perhaps oviduct epithelial cells. But I'm not certain.

Given that Hoxb7 is strong in mammary gland and kidney, and Rprm is in mammary tumors, maybe mammary epithelial cells are higher. But Calb1 is not typical there. Unless there's a specific subtype.

Wait, but Calb1 in mammary cells? Not that I know of. So maybe the presence of Calb1 points more towards kidney. So if the cell has Calb1, Rprm, Hoxb7, etc., perhaps a kidney cell type.

Alternatively, maybe a proximal tubule cell? But Calb1 is more distal.

Alternatively, maybe collecting duct cells? Hoxb7 is involved in ureteric bud, which forms the collecting ducts. So collecting duct cells in kidney would have Hoxb7, Claudins, Mdk. Calb1 might not be there, but maybe in distal tubule.

But then the markers could be from multiple kidney segments. Alternatively, a mix?

Alternatively, the presence of Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b might suggest a different cell type. Let me check specific databases.

Looking up Wfdc2: In mice, Wfdc2 (HE4) is expressed in the epididymis, trachea, and lung. Wfdc15b is also epididymal.

Hoxb7 is in mammary gland and kidney. Rprm in mammary tumor cells.

So if the cell has Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b, that's strong for epididymis. But then what about the other markers? Hoxb7 might not be in epididymis. Claudins could be present in epididymal epithelial cells. Mdk might be there as a growth factor. Ldhb is general. Ptma for proliferation.

Alternatively, maybe the cell type is epididymal epithelial cells. But how do the other markers fit?

Alternatively, perhaps a mix of markers from different cell types, but the user wants the top 3 most likely. Maybe the combination suggests a secretory epithelial cell type, possibly from the reproductive tract, mammary, or kidney.

But given the markers, the strongest indicators are:

- Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b for epididymis or oviduct.

- Hoxb7 and Rprm for mammary or kidney.

- Calb1 for kidney or neurons.

Claudins are in epithelial cells, so combining these, perhaps the top three are:

1. Kidney epithelial cells (distal tubule/collecting duct)
2. Mammary gland epithelial cells
3. Epididymal epithelial cells

Alternatively, if Wfdc markers are more dominant, maybe epididymal cells first. But how do other markers align?

Alternatively, considering that Hoxb7 is in both mammary and kidney, and Rprm is in mammary tumors, but the user is asking for normal cells. So maybe mammary epithelial cells are high.

But Calb1 is not typically in mammary. So perhaps kidney is higher because of Calb1, Hoxb7, Claudins, Mdk.

Then, mammary as second, epididymal third.

Alternatively, the presence of both Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b might push epididymal cells higher. Let me check: Wfdc15b is specifically expressed in the epididymis. So if both Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are present, that strongly suggests epididymal epithelial cells. Then, how do the other markers fit?

Hoxb7: Not sure about epididymis. But Claudins (6 and 7) are found in epididymal epithelium. Ldhb would be there for metabolism. Mdk might be involved in growth or maintenance. Rprm could be in epididymis? Not sure. Calb1 might not be, unless it's a specific segment.

If the cell has markers specific to epididymis (Wfdc2, Wfdc15b), then even if other markers are present, the top cell type might be epididymal epithelial cells. Then, kidney and mammary next.

But the user wants the top 3, so maybe:

1. Epididymal epithelial cells
2. Kidney epithelial cells
3. Mammary epithelial cells

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: Let's look for cell types that commonly co-express these markers.

Alternatively, check the CellMarker database or Mouse Cell Atlas.

For example:

- **Epididymal epithelial cells**: Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, Cldn7.

- **Kidney distal tubule cells**: Calb1, Cldn6/7, Hoxb7 (maybe in collecting duct), Mdk.

- **Mammary epithelial cells**: Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6/7, Mdk.

So, if the markers are a mix from these three, then the top 3 cell types would be these three.

But the user wants the most likely, so the presence of both Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b is a strong indicator for epididymis. However, the other markers (Hoxb7, Rprm, etc.) might suggest mammary or kidney.

Alternatively, the cell type could be a cancer cell line derived from one of these tissues, but the question is about normal mouse cells.

Given the uncertainty, but needing to provide the top 3, I'll go with:

1. Epididymal epithelial cells
2. Kidney distal tubule epithelial cells
3. Mammary gland epithelial cells

Alternatively, the order could vary. Maybe kidney comes first because of more markers aligning (Calb1, Hoxb7, Claudins, Mdk), while epididymis has two specific markers but others not as strong. So:

1. Kidney epithelial cells
2. Epididymal epithelial cells
3. Mammary epithelial cells

But Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are very specific to epididymis, so perhaps they should be first.

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects different cell types. For example, some of the markers are found in Sertoli cells, but I don't think so.

Another possibility: The presence of Ptma and Ldhb suggests high proliferation and metabolism, which could be in stem cells or cancer cells, but again, the question is about normal cell types.

Considering all markers, the most probable top 3 would be:

1. Kidney epithelial cells (distal tubule/collecting duct)
2. Epididymal epithelial cells
3. Mammary gland epithelial cells

But I'm not entirely certain. Another check: Hoxb7 is critical for mammary gland development. If Hoxb7 is present, that's a strong indicator for mammary epithelial cells. So if Hoxb7 is there along with Rprm (from mammary tumor context), maybe mammary is higher.

But Calb1 is in kidney. So the cell might be a mix, but the question is about the most likely cell types given the markers.

Alternatively, the markers could indicate a mixture, but each marker's presence points to different cell types. The top three would then be the three cell types that have the highest number of markers.

In that case:

- Kidney: Calb1, Hoxb7, Cldn6, Cldn7, Mdk, Ldhb → 6 markers
- Epididymis: Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, Cldn7 → 3 markers
- Mammary: Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6, Cldn7, Mdk → 5 markers

So kidney would have the most markers, then mammary, then epididymis. But wait, Calb1 is kidney-specific here, along with Hoxb7 (if in kidney), claudins, Mdk, Ldhb. That's 6 markers. Mammary would have Rprm, Hoxb7, Cldn6, Cldn7, Mdk → 5. Epididymis has Wfdc2, Wfdc15b, maybe Cldn7 → 3.

So then the order would be:

1. Kidney epithelial cells
2. Mammary epithelial cells
3. Epididymal epithelial cells

But this counts the number of markers, but some markers might be more specific. For example, Wfdc2 and Wfdc15b are very specific to epididymis, even if fewer, so their presence might strongly indicate that cell type despite fewer markers. However, in terms of probability, if a cell has more markers pointing to a type, it's more likely.

Alternatively, if a cell has markers from multiple types, but the combination is unique. However, I think this is a case where the number of markers per cell type might determine the ranking.

So, based on counts:

1. Kidney epithelial cells (6 markers)
2. Mammary epithelial cells (5 markers)
3. Epididymal epithelial cells (3 markers)

Thus, the answer would be:

Kidney epithelial cells, Mammary epithelial cells, Epididymal epithelial cells
</think>

Kidney epithelial cells, Mammary gland epithelial cells, Epididymal epithelial cells
