Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here are the marker genes, please finish the task: Chga, Pcsk2, Chgb, Pyy, Pcsk1n, Iapp, Resp18, Ins2, Gcg, Scg2
---------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some related literature segments for your reference. Please do not infer solely based on these segments:
pmcid: PMC10187016
section: DISCUSS
content: Some DE genes related to pancreatic islet dysfunction (Iapp, Scg2, Chga, Chgb, Slc30a8), carbohydrate and glycogen metabolism (Amy2a5, Gcg, Ins1, Amy1), protein hydrolysis (Try5, Cpa1, Gm13011, Try4, Cpb1), lipid metabolism (Ins1, Pnlip), neuroendocrine (Vstm2l, Resp18) were significantly upregulated, which undoubtedly increased the basic metabolic rate of the mice with MTB infection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pmcid: PMC10543725
section: RESULTS
content: Importantly, while the S961-induced Gast+ gene signature included several genes found in other islet cell types (i.e.  Gcg, Sst, Cck, Chga, Chgb, Pyy, and Iapp), there was little likeness at the gene expression level with naturally resident mouse islet alpha, delta, and PP cells (Figure 2E and Supplemental Table 1).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pmcid: PMC5092539
section: RESULTS
content: Not surprisingly, canonical marker genes for alpha and beta cells (GCG, MAFA, IAPP, CHGB, INS, INS-IGF2, SCG2, PCSK1, and PCSK2) were in the list, as were genes found in studies that analyzed enriched populations of alpha or beta cells, such as TTR, which is specific in mouse alpha cells; NPTX2 in beta cells (Figure S2A); and group-specific component (GC) in human alpha cells.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Chga, Pcsk2, Chgb, Pyy, Pcsk1n, Iapp, Resp18, Ins2, Gcg, Scg2. I need to make sure I get this right by analyzing each marker and cross-referencing with the provided literature.

First, I'll list out the markers again to see if any stand out. Chga and Chgb are Chromogranin A and B, which I know are commonly found in neuroendocrine cells, including pancreatic islet cells. Gcg is glucagon, a classic alpha cell marker. Ins2 is insulin 2, which is a beta cell marker. Iapp is islet amyloid polypeptide, also associated with beta cells. Pcsk2 is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2, involved in hormone processing, found in both alpha and beta cells. Pyy is peptide YY, which I recall is present in pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Scg2 is secretogranin II, another neuroendocrine marker. Resp18 is regulated endocrine-specific protein 18, which the literature mentions in the context of neuroendocrine cells. Pcsk1n might be a related gene, perhaps involved in processing as well.

Looking at the literature snippets provided: The first one (PMC10187016) mentions Chga, Chgb, Iapp, Gcg, Scg2 in the context of pancreatic islet dysfunction. The second (PMC10543725) links Gcg, Sst, Cck, Chga, Chgb, Pyy, Iapp with islet cell types like alpha, delta, and PP cells. The third (PMC5092539) notes that markers like GCG (Gcg), MAFA, IAPP, CHGB, INS (Ins2), SCG2, PCSK1/2 are canonical for alpha and beta cells.

Putting this together, the presence of both Ins2 (beta) and Gcg (alpha) suggests that the cells might be from pancreatic islets. However, some markers like Pyy are more specific to PP cells. But wait, beta cells primarily express Ins and Iapp, alpha cells express Gcg, PP cells express Pyy. However, the list includes both Ins2 and Gcg, which are markers for beta and alpha cells respectively. But how can a single cell type have both? Unless these markers are from a mixture of cells. But the question is about the top 3 cell types, so perhaps each cell type has some of these markers.

Wait, maybe the markers are not all from one cell type but a combination. The user is asking for the top 3 cell types based on the markers provided. So each cell type would have a subset of these markers. For example, beta cells would have Ins2, Iapp, Pcsk2, maybe Chga, Chgb, Scg2. Alpha cells would have Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2. PP cells have Pyy. Then there's also Resp18 mentioned in neuroendocrine cells.

Looking at PMC5092539, the list includes alpha and beta cell markers: GCG (alpha), INS (beta), IAPP (beta), CHGB (both?), SCG2, PCSK2 (both). So beta cells would have Ins2, Iapp, Pcsk2, Chga, Chgb, Scg2. Alpha cells have Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2. PP cells have Pyy. Then Resp18 is in neuroendocrine, which includes all islet cells.

So the markers provided include those from beta (Ins2, Iapp), alpha (Gcg), PP (Pyy), and common neuroendocrine markers (Chga, Chgb, Scg2, Pcsk2, Resp18). So the presence of both alpha and beta markers might indicate a mix, but the question is about the top 3 cell types. So perhaps the first is beta cells (since Ins2 and Iapp are strong beta markers), then alpha cells (Gcg), then PP cells (Pyy). Alternatively, maybe enteroendocrine cells, but the literature mentions pancreatic islet cells.

Wait, the third literature segment (PMC5092539) specifically says that the canonical markers for alpha and beta cells include GCG (alpha), INS (beta), IAPP (beta), CHGB, SCG2, PCSK2. So beta cells would have INS (Ins2), IAPP, CHGA/CHGB, SCG2, PCSK2. Alpha cells have GCG, CHGA/CHGB, PCSK2. PP cells have Pyy. So given the markers here, the top cell type would be beta cells, then alpha, then PP cells. But the presence of both alpha and beta markers might suggest that the cell could be a mix, but the user is asking for cell types, so individual types.

Alternatively, maybe enteroendocrine cells also express some of these markers, but the literature mentions pancreatic islet cells. So the answer would be pancreatic beta cells, pancreatic alpha cells, and pancreatic PP cells. Let me verify.

Chga and Chgb are general neuroendocrine markers found in all islet cells. Ins2 is specific to beta, Gcg to alpha, Pyy to PP. So if a cell has Ins2, it's beta. If it has Gcg, it's alpha. If Pyy, then PP. But the list here includes all these markers. So maybe the markers are from a dataset that includes multiple cell types. But the question is to determine the top 3 cell types based on the presence of these markers. So each marker is a clue for a cell type.

So beta cells: Ins2, Iapp, Pcsk2, Chga, Chgb, Scg2, maybe Pcsk1n (if similar to PCSK1), Resp18.

Alpha cells: Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, maybe others.

PP cells: Pyy, along with some of the general markers.

So the presence of Ins2 and Gcg might suggest that the markers are from a mixture, but the task is to list the cell types. So the top 3 would be:

1. Pancreatic beta cells (Ins2, Iapp, Pcsk2, Chga, Chgb, Scg2, Resp18)
2. Pancreatic alpha cells (Gcg, Chga, Chgb, Pcsk2, Scg2, Resp18)
3. Pancreatic PP cells (Pyy, along with Chga, Chgb, etc.)

Alternatively, maybe enteroendocrine cells also express some of these, but the literature provided is all about pancreatic islets. So I think the answer is Beta cells, Alpha cells, and PP cells, in that order.
