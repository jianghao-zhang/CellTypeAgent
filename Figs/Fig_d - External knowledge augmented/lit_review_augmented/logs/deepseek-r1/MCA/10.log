Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here are the marker genes, please finish the task: Camp, Ngp, S100a9, S100a8, Chil3, Ltf, Wfdc21, Lcn2, Fcnb, Pglyrp1

Here are some related literature segments for your reference. Please do not infer solely based on these segments:
pmcid: PMC11326406
section: RESULTS
content: Surprisingly, myeloid cell-specific genes and genes associated with anti-pathogen and innate immune responses normally activated in myeloid cells, such as S100a9, S100a8, S100a6, S100a11, Retnlg, Ngp, Camp, Lcn2, Lyz2, Wfdc21, Chil3, and Pglyrp1 were highly expressed in Ptpn11E76K/+ LT-HSCs.

pmcid: PMC8377972
section: RESULTS
content: Given the variance in late disease spinal cord expression profiles already noted, we found limited power to resolve statistically significant expression differences in this anatomic site, with increased expression of a gene cluster comprised of S100a8, S100a9, Ngp, Camp, Retnlg, Wfdc21, Lcn2, Chil3 and Ltf, and decreased expression of Rapgef1 the most notable observations.

pmcid: PMC11326406
section: DISCUSS
content: These mutant stem cells exhibit strikingly heightened expression of evolutionarily conserved genes that are typically activated in mature myeloid cells during pathogen defense, including anti-microbial peptides (Camp, Lcn2, Lyz2, Ltf, Chil3, and Pglyrp1) and essential trace metal-sequestering proteins (S100a9 and S100a8), which also function as pro-inflammatory proteins triggering and amplifying innate immune responses.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given markers: Camp, Ngp, S100a9, S100a8, Chil3, Ltf, Wfdc21, Lcn2, Fcnb, Pglyrp1.

First, I need to recall what these markers are typically associated with. S100a8 and S100a9 are known as calprotectin components, commonly found in neutrophils. Camp is cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, also prominent in neutrophils. Ngp is neutrophil granule protein, which is pretty specific. Ltf is lactoferrin, another neutrophil marker. Chil3 is chitinase-like 3, which might be related to macrophages or other immune cells. Lcn2 is lipocalin 2, also associated with neutrophils. Wfdc21 and Pglyrp1 are less familiar, but the literature mentions them in the context of myeloid cells and innate immunity.

Looking at the provided literature snippets, they mention that these genes are expressed in LT-HSCs (long-term hematopoietic stem cells) with a mutation, but the markers themselves are typically myeloid. The first PMC article says these genes are normally activated in myeloid cells. The second PMC article talks about these markers in the context of spinal cord disease, again pointing towards immune cells. The third discussion section mentions myeloid cells and anti-microbial peptides.

So, the markers are all pointing towards cells of the myeloid lineage, especially neutrophils. Other possibilities might include other granulocytes or macrophages. But given the combination of S100a8/S100a9, Camp, Ngp, and Ltf, neutrophils are the strongest candidates. Then maybe myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which also express S100a8/9. Alternatively, monocytes or macrophages could be considered, but Chil3 (Ym1) is sometimes associated with alternatively activated macrophages. However, the dominance of neutrophil markers probably pushes macrophages to a lower rank.

Wait, but the literature mentions these genes are expressed in HSCs with a mutation, but the question is about normal cell types. So the answer should be based on standard marker associations. So, the top three would be:

1. Neutrophils (most markers match here)
2. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) since they also express S100a8/9 and other granulocyte markers
3. Macrophages (some markers like Chil3, Ltf might be present, but less specific)

Alternatively, maybe granulocytes as a broader category, but neutrophils are a subset. So the top three cell types are Neutrophils, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and Macrophages. But let me double-check.

Fcnb (Ficolin B) is expressed in macrophages and monocytes. Hmm, but if the majority of markers are neutrophil-specific, then the order might be Neutrophils, followed by granulocytes, then MDSCs or macrophages. Alternatively, maybe monocyte subsets. But given the literature mentions that these are normally in myeloid cells, especially anti-microbial responses, which are strong in neutrophils. So the top 3 should be:

1. Neutrophils
2. Granulocytes (though more general)
3. Myeloid cells (but maybe MDSCs specifically)

Alternatively, other sources may indicate that S100a8/9 are also in monocytes. But with Camp, Ngp, Ltf, the strongest is neutrophils. So likely:

Neutrophils, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Monocytes. Or perhaps Macrophages.

Wait, Chil3 (Ym1) is a marker for alternatively activated macrophages (M2). But in the presence of multiple neutrophil markers, maybe macrophages are third. So the answer would be:

Neutrophils, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Macrophages.

I think that's the most probable ranking based on the markers provided.

Neutrophils, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Macrophages
