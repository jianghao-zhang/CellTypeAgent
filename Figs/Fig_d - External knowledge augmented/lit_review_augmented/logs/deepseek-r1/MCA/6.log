Human: 
Identify most likely top 3 cell types of mouse cells using the following markers. Only provide the lists of top 3 cell type names. The higher the probability, the further left it is ranked, separated by commas.

Here are the marker genes, please finish the task: Prm1, Prm2, Meig1, Ldhc, Tnp1, Fabp9, Tnp2, Smcp, Rbakdn, Ropn1l

Here are some related literature segments for your reference. Please do not infer solely based on these segments:
pmcid: PMC6219387
section: None
content: Examples of well-studied transcripts whose synthesis and translation are temporally disconnected include mRNAs encoding transition proteins (Tnp1 and Tnp2), protamine proteins (Prm1 and Prm2), and the sperm mitochondrial associated cysteinerich protein (Smcp), all of which are encoded by genes that are essential for proper germ cell development in mice.

Okay, so I need to figure out the top 3 cell types of mouse cells based on the given markers: Prm1, Prm2, Meig1, Ldhc, Tnp1, Fabp9, Tnp2, Smcp, Rbakdn, Ropn1l. Let me start by recalling what these markers are associated with.

First, looking at Prm1 and Prm2. I remember that protamines like PRM1 and PRM2 are involved in chromatin condensation in sperm cells. They replace histones during spermiogenesis, which is part of sperm development. So that's a strong hint towards sperm cells or germ cells involved in sperm formation.

Then there's Tnp1 and Tnp2. The transition proteins TNPs are also involved in the same process as protamines. They help in the transition from histone-based chromatin to protamine-based packaging in developing sperm. The literature segment provided mentions Tnp1, Tnp2, Prm1, Prm2, and Smcp as essential for germ cell development in mice. So that reinforces the idea that these are markers for spermatogenic cells or sperm themselves.

Smcp is mentioned in the literature as sperm mitochondrial associated cysteine-rich protein. That's pretty specific to sperm, as mitochondria are important for sperm motility (the midpiece of sperm has lots of mitochondria). So Smcp is likely a marker for sperm cells.

Other markers: Ldhc. Lactate dehydrogenase C is a testis-specific isoform. Ldhc is expressed in male germ cells, particularly in spermatocytes and spermatids. So again pointing towards germ cells or sperm.

Fabp9 is Fatty Acid Binding Protein 9, which is also known to be expressed in testis, specifically in spermatids. Meig1 (Marker of Germinal Epithelium 1) is involved in spermiogenesis. Ropn1l is a protein associated with sperm motility, part of the fibrous sheath in the sperm flagellum. Rbakdn might be a typo, but perhaps it's related to a gene involved in spermatogenesis. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for another gene, but given the context, I'll assume it's related to germ cells.

Putting this all together, all these markers are highly specific to male germ cells, particularly those in the later stages of spermatogenesis, such as spermatids and mature sperm cells. The transition proteins and protamines are crucial during the final stages when the sperm's chromatin is condensed. So the cell types here are likely spermatids (which are the precursors to spermatozoa), spermatozoa themselves, and possibly other germ cells like spermatocytes, but given the markers, spermatids and sperm cells are more likely.

So the top three cell types would be in order of probability: 1. Spermatids (since they express these transition proteins and protamines during their development), 2. Spermatozoa (mature sperm cells which have completed spermiogenesis and retain these proteins), 3. Maybe Spermatocytes (the earlier stage cells, but some markers like Ldhc are present here too). However, considering the markers listed, the strongest association is with the later stages. Alternatively, maybe another cell type in the testis, but I think the first two are clear, and the third could be another germ cell type involved in late stages.
