Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to identify the top 3 mouse cell types based on the given marker genes. The markers provided are Rps13-ps1, Rps3a3, Dppa5a, Gm10036, Gm11942, Tdgf1, Gm15459, Stmn2, Chchd10, Tdh.

First, I need to recall what each of these markers signifies. Let's go through each one:

1. **Dppa5a**: From the literature provided (PMC2770715), Dppa5a is mentioned in the context of ES cell pluripotency. It's listed alongside other genes like Tdgf1, which is also in our marker list. This suggests that Dppa5a and Tdgf1 are associated with embryonic stem cells.

2. **Tdgf1**: Similarly, from the same literature, Tdgf1 is explicitly listed as a gene associated with ES cell pluripotency. This strengthens the case for embryonic stem cells.

3. **Stmn2**: Looking at PMC5374502 and PMC7115095, Stmn2 is mentioned in both contexts. In PMC5374502, it's associated with mouse MGE immature neurons. In PMC7115095, Stmn2 is listed under neuron-specific markers. So Stmn2 is a strong indicator for neurons.

Now, the other markers: Rps13-ps1 and Rps3a3 are ribosomal proteins, which are often found in many cells, so they might not be specific. Gm genes (Gm10036, Gm11942, Gm15459) are often uncharacterized or pseudogenes, so they might not be informative. Chchd10 and Tdh: Chchd10 is involved in mitochondrial function, which is common in many cells. Tdh (Threonine dehydrogenase) might be specific to certain cell types, but I'm not sure. 

Putting this together, the strongest markers here are Dppa5a and Tdgf1 pointing towards embryonic stem cells, and Stmn2 pointing towards neurons. 

Wait, the presence of both ES cell markers (Dppa5a, Tdgf1) and a neuronal marker (Stmn2) is a bit conflicting. Could there be a cell type that's a progenitor or a stem cell transitioning into neurons? Alternatively, maybe the sample has a mix, but the user wants the top 3. 

Looking back at the literature: In PMC2770715, the genes are in ES cells. In PMC7115095, Stmn2 is in neurons. So if a cell has both Dppa5a, Tdgf1, and Stmn2, maybe it's a pluripotent stem cell differentiating towards neurons? But that might be a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the cell is an embryonic stem cell (since Dppa5a and Tdgf1 are strong there), but also expressing Stmn2, which could indicate early neuronal differentiation. However, the user wants the most likely cell types based on markers. 

Another angle: Are there any other markers here? Let's check Tdh. Threonine dehydrogenase is involved in amino acid metabolism. Maybe in certain stem cells or other cell types? Not sure. Chchd10 is mitochondrial, but not specific. The Gm genes are not informative.

So, the top markers are Dppa5a, Tdgf1 (ES cells), Stmn2 (neurons). However, the presence of both might suggest a progenitor cell. But given that the user wants the top 3 cell types, perhaps the highest probability is embryonic stem cells because of Dppa5a and Tdgf1, then neurons because of Stmn2, and maybe another cell type. Wait, what about the other markers? Are any others specific?

Looking again: The user provided other markers like Gm10036, etc., but without literature support, perhaps they are less important. 

Wait, in PMC7115095, the neuronal markers include Stmn2, Rbfox3, Syt1, Syn1. So Stmn2 alone is a neuron marker. Therefore, if a cell expresses Stmn2, it's likely a neuron. But if it also expresses Dppa5a and Tdgf1, which are ES cell markers, is there a cell type that co-expresses these? Or perhaps the cell is a pluripotent stem cell that's starting to differentiate into neurons, hence expressing both. But typically, embryonic stem cells would express pluripotency markers, and upon differentiation, they downregulate those and upregulate lineage-specific markers. So co-expression might be rare. Alternatively, maybe the cell is in a very early differentiation stage. But given that the user wants the most likely cell types, maybe the top two would be embryonic stem cells and neurons, but which one is higher?

Looking at the markers: Dppa5a and Tdgf1 are both ES markers. Stmn2 is a neuron marker. If the cell has both sets, but perhaps more weight to the ES markers. However, the presence of Stmn2 might suggest a neural progenitor cell. Alternatively, maybe the cell is a neuron that retains some pluripotency markers, but that's less likely. 

Wait, but in the first literature (PMC5374502), Stmn2 is expressed in mouse MGE immature neurons. So maybe immature neurons or neural progenitors. But the other markers (Dppa5a, Tdgf1) are from ES cells. Unless there's a cell type that's both. Alternatively, perhaps the cell is an embryonic stem cell (ES), and the presence of Stmn2 is a contamination or a co-expression. But in standard knowledge, ES cells don't express Stmn2. Stmn2 is more neuronal. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a germ cell? Because Dppa5a is also known to be expressed in germ cells. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a primordial germ cell, which might express some pluripotency markers. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a neural stem cell. But neural stem cells might not express Dppa5a. 

Wait, the key here is to look at the combination. The presence of Dppa5a and Tdgf1 strongly suggests ES cells. Stmn2 suggests neurons. So the top three cell types would be:

1. Embryonic Stem Cell (due to Dppa5a, Tdgf1)
2. Neuron (due to Stmn2)
3. ?

Then, what's the third? Let's check other markers. Rps13-ps1 and Rps3a3 are ribosomal proteins. Those are in most cells, so not helpful. Gm genes are unknowns. Tdh: Threonine dehydrogenase. Maybe liver cells? But Tdh is also found in some neural cells. Chchd10 is mitochondrial, not specific. 

Alternatively, maybe another cell type from the literature. In PMC7115095, the other cell types are microglia, astrocytes, endothelial, OPC, oligodendrocytes. None of the markers here match those, except maybe Stmn2 for neurons. So maybe the third could be another cell type, but given the markers, perhaps the third is a germ cell? Or another pluripotent cell type. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a progenitor cell. But without more markers, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the third is another type of stem cell. 

Wait, Dppa5a is also expressed in primordial germ cells. So maybe the third could be germ cells. 

Alternatively, looking at the other markers: Tdh (Threonine dehydrogenase) is involved in threonine catabolism. It's expressed in the liver, but also in some stem cells? Not sure. 

Alternatively, given that the user wants the top 3, perhaps after ES cells and neurons, the third could be another cell type that shares some of the other markers. But given that the other markers are not informative, maybe the third is a cell type that's related to ES cells, like induced pluripotent stem cells, but that's a type of ES cell. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a neural progenitor cell, given the combination of Stmn2 and some other markers. But without more neural progenitor markers, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe check if any other markers in the list are mentioned in the literature. For example, the user's markers include Tdgf1, which is in the ES cell list. So ES cell is a strong candidate. Stmn2 for neuron. Then, perhaps the third is a germ cell, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is another cell type that expresses Dppa5a. Looking up Dppa5a, it's a pluripotency marker in ES cells and germ cells. So maybe germ cells. 

But the user wants the top 3 most likely. So perhaps:

1. Embryonic Stem Cell
2. Neuron
3. Germ Cell (due to Dppa5a)

But I'm not sure if germ cells would have Tdgf1. Alternatively, maybe the third is a neural progenitor. 

Alternatively, considering that the user's marker list has multiple genes (even if some are pseudogenes), but without more info, maybe the third is a cell type that's not covered by the literature, but based on general knowledge. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a neuronal stem cell, but again, not sure. 

Alternatively, since ES cells are number 1, neurons number 2, maybe the third is another cell type that's in the same lineage. For example, if ES cells differentiate into neurons, maybe neural progenitor cells. But without specific markers for that, it's hard. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a cell type from another category. But given the markers, I think the top two are clear: ES cells and neurons. The third might be a stretch. 

Wait, looking back at the user's query, they also mention "mouse cells". So in mouse, Dppa5a is a well-known ES cell marker. Tdgf1 (also known as Cripto) is another ES cell marker. Stmn2 is a neuronal marker. 

So the top three would likely be:

1. Embryonic Stem Cells
2. Neurons
3. ?

For the third, maybe some other cell type. Looking at the other markers: Chchd10 is mitochondrial, so maybe a cell type with high mitochondrial activity, like muscle cells? But that's a stretch. Tdh: maybe liver, but not indicated here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a cell type that's in the same family as neurons, like astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, but there's no markers here for those. The Gm genes are not informative. 

Alternatively, given that some markers are ribosomal proteins (Rps genes), which are in all cells, they don't help. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a teratoma cell, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, considering that Dppa5a is also expressed in germ cells, as I thought before, maybe the third is germ cells. 

But I need to confirm. For example, Dppa5a (also known as Prame family member) is indeed expressed in ES cells and germ cells. Tdgf1 (Cripto) is involved in early development and ES cells. So if the cell has both, ES cells are more likely than germ cells. But germ cells might express Dppa5a but not Tdgf1. So maybe the third is germ cells. 

Alternatively, maybe induced pluripotent stem cells, but that's similar to ES cells. 

Alternatively, maybe the cell is a epiblast stem cell, but again, similar to ES. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a cell type that's not covered in the provided literature but known to express some of these markers. 

Given the uncertainty, but needing to provide three, perhaps the top three are:

Embryonic Stem Cell, Neuron, Germ Cell

But I'm not very confident about the third. Alternatively, maybe the third is another cell type from the literature. Looking at PMC7115095, the other cell types are microglia, astrocytes, endothelial, OPC, oligodendrocytes. None of the markers match those. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a neural crest cell, but again, no markers here. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's Gm genes are specific to certain cells. But since they're labeled as Gm (genome annotated genes), they might not be well-characterized. 

In the absence of clear markers for a third cell type, perhaps the third could be a progenitor cell type, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only two, but the instruction says top 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a cell type from the first literature's MGE immature neurons, but that's a subset of neurons. 

Alternatively, considering that Dppa5a and Tdgf1 are ES markers, and Stmn2 is a neuron marker, maybe the cell is a mixture, but the user wants the top 3 individual cell types. So the top three would be:

Embryonic Stem Cell, Neuron, and then maybe another cell type where Tdgf1 is expressed. 

Wait, Tdgf1 is also known as Cripto, which is involved in the Nodal signaling pathway and is expressed in ES cells and certain cancer cells. But unless there's a cancer cell type here, maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a primordial germ cell. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a cell from the early embryo, like trophoblast stem cells, but I don't think those express Dppa5a. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is a different type of stem cell, like epiblast stem cells, but again, Dppa5a is more ES-specific. 

Given all this, I think the safest bet is to list:

1. Embryonic Stem Cell (due to Dppa5a and Tdgf1)
2. Neuron (due to Stmn2)
3. Germ Cell (due to Dppa5a)

But I'm not entirely certain about the third. Alternatively, if Stmn2 is a strong enough marker, maybe the third is a Neural Progenitor Cell. However, in the literature, Stmn2 is in immature neurons. 

Alternatively, another approach: check if any of the other markers besides Dppa5a, Tdgf1, and Stmn2 are specific. For example, Rps13-ps1 and Rps3a3 are ribosomal proteins, which are not cell-type specific. Gm genes are likely pseudogenes or not well-characterized. Tdh and Chchd10 don't point to specific cell types. 

Therefore, the third might be a stretch. But the user wants three. Maybe the third is a cell type that expresses some of the other markers. Alternatively, maybe the third is a cell type that's a false positive. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a neuroblastoma cell line, which is cancerous neurons, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is a pluripotent cell type, but that's already covered by ES cells. 

Given the uncertainty, I think the top two are clear, and for the third, perhaps germ cells. 

Therefore, the answer would be:

Embryonic Stem Cell, Neuron, Germ Cell

Embryonic Stem Cell, Neuron, Germ Cell
